<seg id="1">As his teacher admits shooting his girlfriend during a 911 call</seg>
<seg id="2">Voice only slightly coloured university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the emergency call to the police that he shot his girlfriend and that police will have to come to their house.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lamb stressed that his "Golden Dog" is alive and probably upset, and said that the dead woman's next of kin contact details can be found on this phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inside the house, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and notebook to the side, a handwritten message: "I'm so very sorry I wish I could undo this, I loved her and she's the only woman who has ever loved me," said the letter, which is signed by experts, according to lamb.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was nothing to suggest that the lamb, who taught two online course in Minnesota, Delta State University in Cleveland, had already traveled nearly 500 miles to the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed a history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, this office door.</seg>
<seg id="6">Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford told the university staff heard about the shooting at 10.18.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said Lamb called fateful 911 Call for some time after that.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of the day the death toll rose with one more: lamb committed suicide äntä surrounded by police.</seg>
<seg id="9">Authorities are still trying to figure out motive lamb the day after pupils and staff must have school shootings because of hiding behind locked doors.</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigators on both sides of the state have published information according to which the students and staff of the Lamb described as a gifted teacher, which, however, may have been a problem.</seg>
<seg id="11">The students told me they expected his hours.</seg>
<seg id="12">Prentiss, kuolinpaikkakunnan gautierin, police say that the lamb had a violent past or a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schmidt himself was incorporated into his lamb wrote a book, in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both had taught social sciences and history department, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended the training courses for both men.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the other hand, was the sight of some of the problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">A student named Brandon Beavers said Lamb, but also said that he seemed nervous and agitated, as if something had been wrong "ikään. "</seg>
<seg id="17">The second student Mikel Sykes said Lamb told him that he had a lot of stress in the academic year to 15 at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lamb had previously asked for sick leave from Delta State universitysta, saying that he was some kind of health problem.</seg>
<seg id="19">This year, he only taught two online course.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recent changes in the university pay principle means that, although the lamb had worked so hard to get his doctorate in front, it does not guarantee him automatic career development and assistant professor posts.</seg>
<seg id="21">The university provost William Laforge said that no lamb between Schmidt and she knows she's no contradiction, but that "clearly in Lamb's mind was something."</seg>
<seg id="22">These are the questions that lamb is no longer able to respond.</seg>
<seg id="23">After Lamb had fled the campus, the police got on his trail, when he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas State.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before he was arrested, lamb, shot himself with a .38 pistol in a house in the back yard approximately one and a half miles south of his parents' house in Mississippi, a suburb of Greenville, told the Washington County coroner methel Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="25">Lamb, the car was still in the running in the driveway.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear why the Lamb went to this particular house, although Johnson said that he believed that the Lamb knew people who live there.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lamb grew up in the area.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lamb started work at the university in 2009, and taught geography and science education, university has 3,500 students and is located in the city, which is about 12 000 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="29">Lamb completed a doctorate in science education in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of the lamb's old friend describes him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.</seg>
<seg id="31">Carla Hairston told me he was 15 years old and the lamb is 20 years old, when they met through a mutual friend.</seg>
<seg id="32">Hairston and his friend was in high school, and the lamb was nice, older guy, who tried for many years to teach hairstonia play the guitar.</seg>
<seg id="33">He was quite the charmer in those days.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the girls were putty in your hands, when he was at the scene told me, now 40 years old, Hairston, who lives in a Jackson suburb in brandonissa.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been seeing each other for a while.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the emergency call Lamb told me that he killed his wife, but for their marriage and there is no evidence.</seg>
<seg id="37">They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the river in a brick house gautierissa.</seg>
<seg id="38">The police told me the dog is fine.</seg>
<seg id="39">Prentiss's former husband Shawn o'steen told me they divorced 15 years ago, but remain friends, they now have a 19-year-old daughter.</seg>
<seg id="40">"he is very upset," o'steen described her daughter.</seg>
<seg id="41">He was his mother's best friend.</seg>
<seg id="42">O'steen told me that he hadn't met a lamb, but was heard from his daughter Abigail, that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lamb met with Prentiss, when Lamb and Abigail were both performing at the summer market three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="44">Later, they played together a few gigs.</seg>
<seg id="45">O'steen told me that his daughter is doing and sing his own music.</seg>
<seg id="46">Prentiss was a nurse who worked for a number of online businesses.</seg>
<seg id="47">Gautierin lighting of a bar near the Rome Julep bartender and occasional entertainment organizer Mike Shaffer, says he saw that lamb and Prentiss last September 5 the night before, when the lamb was done with his guitar and harmonica performance for the low number of visitors.</seg>
<seg id="48">Nothing seems to be wrong.</seg>
<seg id="49">"just a happy couple," he said.</seg>
<seg id="50">We were just goofing around and throwing one-liners at each other.</seg>
<seg id="51">So they were both quite clever.</seg>
<seg id="52">The dead teacher Schmidt led the first year students seminar programme and is a specialist in Indian and colonial history, a high school English teacher told me don Allan Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="53">Schmidt was married and had three small children.</seg>
<seg id="54">He studied at the Kansas Emporia State University, and was his fraternity and the student government puheejohtaja.</seg>
<seg id="55">Tuesday night in Cleveland at the Delta State campus, held a candlelit prayer, which was attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and members of the community.</seg>
<seg id="56">Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Mass, during which the university choir sang songs of bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.</seg>
<seg id="57">The lesson continues on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="58">"we're trying to get students to come back," Laforge said.</seg>
<seg id="59">The crisis is over.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now is the time for the healing process.</seg>
<seg id="61">Amy reported from Mississippi and Rogelio Solis in Cleveland.</seg>
<seg id="62">Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus of Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.</seg>
<seg id="63">Story has been corrected, according to the police now say Lamb called Schmidt's 911 call after the shooting, and that even if the lamb was referring to a call during the prentissiin as his wife, there is no evidence that they were married.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 poll survey result showing that Donald Trump is serious about</seg>
<seg id="2">Some have tried to label him as a weather vane.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others see him as just a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">Part of the waiting for the collapse.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although some Republicans are trying to get Donald Trump out of the approval ratings polls, the top priority, it is not (yet) failed.</seg>
<seg id="6">In 11 of the last national survey in a decade, Donald Trump has been leading in the numerical figures, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for real estate opportunities for the nomination of the king.</seg>
<seg id="7">Election season is only in its early stages.</seg>
<seg id="8">These results do not mean that Trump is likely to be the Republican candidate.</seg>
<seg id="9">Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing its lead to the rise of Herman Cain, neither of which got in behind any of the state in the nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is also a lot of reasons why we should be a problem for him in the general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">Outside groups, such as Jeb Bush's super PAC and the conservative organization Club for Growth, however, we have taken note of Trump's persistence and beginning to use their resources in order to topple him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Following the recent approval ratings survey results do not suggest that the real estate King is only a passing phase:</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump suosittuus figures have done a U-turn.</seg>
<seg id="14">Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University Polling surveys showed that only two of the 10 Republicans welcomed the real estate King.</seg>
<seg id="15">By the middle of July, the figure was 40%.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the beginning of August, the figure was 52%.</seg>
<seg id="17">Currently six out of 10 Republicans React to Donald trumpiin positively.</seg>
<seg id="18">About three in 10 say that they are negative.</seg>
<seg id="19">These figures are accurate in the first primary state.</seg>
<seg id="20">In a survey carried out by the University of quinnipiacin in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they have a positive attitude to trumpiin.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of Republican voters would be satisfied if the Trump should be a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the CNN / orc:n poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "satisfied" or ""innostuneita, if Trump is the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two out of 10 said that they would be "shocked" if he became a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson to roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% ""innostuneita vs. Trump 40%).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next highest cause of enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio by just 21 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters are "dissatisfied" or "upset" if the rulers of favorite Jeb Bush would be the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="28">Trump's fiery temper is not a problem for the majority of Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump has been criticised widely for his bombastic speeches and insults, in Monday's ABC News / Washington Post poll, 52 percent to Republican leaning voters on the national level, I think that's the real estate King is the president for the universal nature of the quality.</seg>
<seg id="30">In quinnipiacin last week, according to a survey of the first meeting of the party in the state of Iowa chapter is the same: 52% of Republicans think that the trumpilla is for leaders agreed the quality of character.</seg>
<seg id="31">ABC / Post poll shows 44%, however, thinks that his character is not suitable for the president to act, and almost six out of ten is of the opinion that it is not his nature belong to the White House.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters get used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">When Republican voters think as commentators, they believe that Trump is a genuine alternative.</seg>
<seg id="34">CNN / orc:n survey, four in 10 had Trump as the most likely alternative to ask who would most likely be appointed as the Republican candidate.</seg>
<seg id="35">Yet at the end of July, four in 10 supported Jeb Bush.</seg>
<seg id="36">Information: julkistus in the Republican Party electorate that has not always been at his disposal of the brightest possible crystal ball.</seg>
<seg id="37">During the last parliamentary term, this time of four out of 10 Republicans felt that Rick Perry will be appointed as a candidate, and only 28% in favour of the final candidate, Mitt Romney.</seg>
<seg id="38">In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters to Trump's campaign to be credible.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if the Republicans will settle in to support another candidate, Trump would win but nearly every one of them.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have contributed to the Trump lead, because contrary to Trump's support is divided among several other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">Monmouth University, who at the beginning of September, the survey showed, however, that in a hypothetical race between Donald Trump and almost all the other Republican candidates, Trump gets majority support in almost all cases.</seg>
<seg id="42">He leads by 13 points, Carly fiorinaa Marco rubiota by 14 points, Walker had 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and Rand Paul, Chris Christie and John kasichia each with 33 points.</seg>
<seg id="43">He is in the positions of the Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">Only Trump the winning candidate?</seg>
<seg id="45">If you set them against each other, Ben Carson, businessman Donald Trump would win by a large margin of 18 points.</seg>
<seg id="46">Barely a majority of Donald Trump supporters have been told to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new CBS / nyt:n poll for Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of Trump voters have decided who to their voice goes.</seg>
<seg id="48">The situation could of course change, no one can be fully sure to say that he would never change his mind.</seg>
<seg id="49">46% said they may switch candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment, is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision, are two times more likely to be Trump's side.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six of the 10 Republican says that we have to agree with Trump on immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, two months ago Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his opening campaign speech, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some people are worried that Trump's bombast to drive Latino voters away from the Republican Party and damaging uudelleenbrändäysyrityksiä.</seg>
<seg id="54">In his Monday published a new ABC / Post kyselytutkimuksen, six in 10 Republicans say Trump is agree with immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, it appears that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="56">Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.</seg>
<seg id="57">Donald Trump and Ben Carson's support now covers about half of the Republican electorate, due in large part to their status outside the policy.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six out of 10 Republicans said Monday ABC / Post survey, that they prefer to opt for an external policy person than someone with government experience.</seg>
<seg id="59">They are also angry at the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="60">Two weeks ago, Des Moines Register / Bloomberg survey of Iowa showed that three of the four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% is "unhappy" and 21 percent "really angry."</seg>

<seg id="2">Metcash is trying to protect from the IGA kauppojaan Aldin invasion of Southern and Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the IGA traders market share in the south and western Australia Aldin $700 million before the attack.</seg>
<seg id="4">Aldi is preparing two distribution centre and the first store opening early next year in the south and Western Australia, which is on the way up to 120 trade. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarketit strengthen its relations with local food with intermediaries and build IGA brand mainstream and social media marketing and events, such as the Adelaide Show, through the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="5">Iga:n merchants and suppliers have jumped in, and brands such as the future of the ice cream manufacturer dunsborough'sta simmo's offer samples in stores, and shop owners iga:n sell discounted tickets to Australian football matches to their stock customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Metcashin is expected to reveal more details about his defense strategy on 29 September, when this food, alcohol, and hardware wholesaler hold annual Investor Strategy days.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is much at stake, since the Southern and Western Australia a total of almost 30 per cent of IGA metcashin shops area, and its profit margins are higher than those of the Eastern Länder metcashin IGA network.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the southern and western Australia shopping visitors are notoriously parochial, and a lot of it is in retailers iga:n greater market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24 percent in the West compared to the eastern states with 14%.</seg>
<seg id="9">Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi get about 5% of the land in these two food market within 12 months of the opening of the first movement, the turnover from all actors, but mainly from independent retailers.</seg>
<seg id="10">In its report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that iga:n retailers may lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi to open next year in the South West, 25 and 30 move, which produces 500 and 600 million dollars in turnover in these areas.</seg>
<seg id="12">In food and food sales and the loss of metcashin high fixed costs base can pay metcashille approximately $13 million operating profit losses before interest and tax, Kierath said.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, Metcash lost market share in eastern states to mainly aldille and Coles, although in a recent Roy Morgan research found that the customers were all loyal iga:n.</seg>
<seg id="14">As Morgan Stanley believes that metcashin food and food sales dropped by 3% in 2016; 4, 1% in 2017 and 2% in 2018, so that its market share will decline from the year 2015, 14% to 10.3% in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week a leading investment fund manager and founder of Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "may very possibly lose in a decade."</seg>

<seg id="18">Iga:n market share has fallen after 2010 from 18% to 14%, and income from metcashin food and food products business, which cares for about 1,200 IGA Retailer, have fallen 43 per cent after 2012. This is about the activities of debt financing and the reduction in sales and margins are under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="19">Wholesalers, however, need to assert themselves, and has invested each year to more than $150 million on a weekly basis for the calculation of the prices of the products to the same level and with the help woolworthsin Coles, IGA retailers renovate stores increasing the fastest growing fresh food, as well as its bringing to market a better range of private label products.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tennis Australia president Steve Healy of the Alliance supports Thanasi kokkinakisia</seg>
<seg id="2">Of Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more credit than criticism of this kind of behaviour</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer as a bystander in the recent storm, which has been raging her friend Nick kyrgioksen around, he deserves more credit than criticism of his own behaviour, says Tennis Australia president Steve Healy, president of the federation.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the name of the so-called "special" see the talented young duo of Kokkinakis forced unwillingly into the public domain about the incident, in which Kyrgios upset Stan wawrinkaa Montreal Masters in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="5">Soon after, in a spicy qualifying match in Cincinnati, the judge twice had to separate the kokkinakisin and his opponent Ryan Harrison, when Harrison declared: "wawrinkan should have beat Kyrgios, and I should beat this kid."</seg>
<seg id="6">While Kokkinakis was last seen smashed his bat after the cramp ruined his possible triumph of Richard gasquetista in U.S. Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of the kokkinakisin.</seg>
<seg id="7">Right now the young man is in Glasgow to compete with Sam grothin From Another Place in kaksinpeleissä tomicin with Bernard in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I'm pretty firmly of the opinion that Thanasi has just pulled into the fray," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He broke his bat when she loses because of a cramp in the U.S. Open, but he is not the first player who breaks his bat in frustration, and I can feel my thanasin well enough to know that he is not proud of it.</seg>
<seg id="10">But he has behaved extremely well, even in quite a provocative situations in the U.S. Open with Harrison, and so on and so forth, and I think he deserves praise.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been a bit harshly.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is very mature for 19 years of age, he works hard to fit in to the team and so on and so forth, and he has never had problems with the other players, he is held in high esteem in the locker room, he trains hard, is in good shape and is very calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged on its merits.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy has also supported the decision not to take the kyrgiosta according to Friday starting important games, describing this as a "joint decision" all proper solutions, but still support a return to regular canberralaisen team rolling.</seg>
<seg id="14">"we want the team to be fully focused on the game and not all controversy [kyrgiosin] around," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="15">And Nick has increased very rapidly, as, for example, Federer and Murray have pointed out, and she's growing up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves everything they get kritisismin. However, we try to support him, we try to help them understand the consequences of their actions, and I believe that is the best thing for both him and the team, if he spends some time away from the public eye to these consequences.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the 2016 elections: national survey, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders has narrowed the lead side</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to lead in the nomination race kaksinumeroisessa Democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders catching up to him.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now supports Democrats (47% of voters, down from 58%), and the second is Sanders supports increased from 27 per cent (17%).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced if he leaves in the presidential race, but he's worth 15% of Democrats in the electorate.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before the primaries began, the majority of Democrat voters, finds that it is still too early to say that they had decided who to vote for.</seg>
<seg id="6">Clinton supporters are standing behind their own choice but more than supporters of the other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton's popularity has fallen a number of population groups in last month's CBS News poll after poll, and at the same time, Sanders has risen somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton is firmly in charge of women and moderates, but his lead has narrowed.</seg>
<seg id="9">His popularity among men has declined dramatically, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton head start in less than 50 years of Democrat voters are gone, and he is now neck and neck with Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="11">Clearly, however, Clinton leads among older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton led Sanders by double digits on the Liberals, but now Sanders leads this team by five percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="13">Around half of the Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she becomes the nominee of the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter say they support him with reservations, and 15% support him just because he is a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">6% don't support him at all.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is hardly surprising that the current Clinton supporters are very likely to be enthusiastic in his support.</seg>
<seg id="17">Opinions are mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton, only a quarter of those support him enthusiastically.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's what 48 percent of Democratic voters say they support Clinton, Republican enthusiasm about the first man on the same Donald Trump says fewer Republican voters (35%).</seg>
<seg id="19">When Clinton supporters were asked in an open question why they wanted him as a candidate, the most popular answer was that he has the right experience (16%). After this, the most popular answer is that now is the right time for a female president (13%) and the fact that he is the best candidate for the job (10 per cent).</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton supporters also mentioned her connection to Bill Clinton (9%).</seg>
<seg id="21">The same opinions as well as the possibility of being elected was also mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="22">Because the vice president seems to a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of Democrat voters would like to see him in the race - even if it is a third disagree.</seg>
<seg id="23">Democrats ask voters who they choose in the second of the party nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among Clinton supporters, more than half said that they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">If Biden decides not to pursue the Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton, the Sanders grows. If Biden goes along, management is 20 percentage points, but if he is opting out, the figure is 30.</seg>
<seg id="26">55% of Democrat voters believes that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential elections, but this figure, however, is down from last month's 78%.</seg>
<seg id="27">By this yardstick Biden lags far behind, but their share of the vote, who like him has increased.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Democrats voters asked what is the most important in a candidate, but they brought the opinions äänestettävyyden ahead.</seg>
<seg id="29">Also last month, one Democratic candidate or potential candidate was not considered a possible candidate for these voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">Democrats candidates or potential candidates are doing well in certain key issues his party among voters.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vast majority have to Clinton, Sanders and bidenia as honest, trustworthy and a strong leader.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden doing the best trio in honesty, while Clinton is the strength of leadership.</seg>
<seg id="33">30% of voters say that the Democrats do not consider Clinton honest and reliable, which is two times more than Sanders (15%), while 27 percent said that they have no opinion of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democrat voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="35">When you look at all these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters say that they have no opinion of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">If Hillary Clinton's personal email address and server operating as foreign minister he's still raise questions, the vast majority of the Democrat voters are satisfied with his explanation of the issue and says that it does not affect their public opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the matter is different, if you look at America as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of the American population is now dissatisfied with her explanation, and only about one-third are satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">The people divided in March, shortly after it came to light.</seg>
<seg id="40">The vast majority of Americans say that the e-mail controversy affected their opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent said that their opinion of him has deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="41">More than six in 10 Republicans said that their opinion of Clinton has changed for the worse.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even though Clinton's own party voters to keep them honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters, only 32% to keep them honest and reliable, and this figure has dropped 8 percentage points from last month and 15 percentage points since May.</seg>
<seg id="43">62% of registered voters say that you do not consider Clinton honest and trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters in the whole country, nor should trump an honest and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="45">Both Trump and Clinton, however, is regarded as a good leader.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six studies with bachelor's bidenia, Carson and Bush are the most honest.</seg>
<seg id="47">As a general rule, Sanders is honest, but not many people have an opinion about him, just as no carsonistakaan.</seg>
<seg id="48">The margin of error in the study, which included 351 Democrat voters is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="1">This is what happens when the US central bank raises interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">Raising interest rates will be, and the emerging market rates fall, bond yields will rise and the economy goes into recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is what we know.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we don't know is how long this all going or how long it takes.</seg>
<seg id="5">The past does not give little help on the timing when it comes to the economy.</seg>
<seg id="6">The recession has taken on the initial drawdown, sometimes after only 11 months, and sometimes has gone as long as 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The US central bank's aggressive in raising interest rates is often, though not always, the determining factor in terms of how to react to the economic and financial resources.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's why the US central bank officials have been so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on the fact that as interest rates start to increase, but mostly to the normalisation of the situation going into the development lifecycle.</seg>
<seg id="9">The equation is indeed a number of variables.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the end, however, market participants may find that all of the increase in the interest rate associated with the fuss has been excessive.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the central bank's first increase since the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as" cheap money "the end of an era," said Capital Economics chief global affairs, economic expert Julian Jessop in a message to customers.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, we do not expect that the United States interest rates gradually return to normal, even though the level is still low, such a cataclysmic shock, which many people seem to be afraid of.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, this does not mean that it will have an impact.</seg>
<seg id="14">Below is a snapshot of how some sectors of the economy will react to a previous development on the basis of:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market has seen in the last month, so the interest rate increase the waiting can make the situation unstable.</seg>
<seg id="16">When the increase comes from the fact that the effect has not been quite so dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"it seems that the return on capital has a tendency to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which possibly reflects the time lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the increase of the central bank.</seg>
<seg id="18">To be more precise, in the last 35 years, so the market is generally strong, in approximately 14% increase as we approach the increase, 250 days after that, the situation is quite flat (average increase of 2.6%), and the normal state is reached 500 days after the average yield of the six in the last cycle, 14.4%, multiplied in the Nuveen Asset Management Company, a leading investment strategist Bob Doll's recent analysis, which was published in the journal Barron's.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche Bank says the impact on equities is usually clear at a later stage in the upward cycle, when profits start to fall.</seg>
<seg id="20">The recession is part of economic life, but interest rates often encourage their entry.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current situation, the central bank is facing certain challenges which were not in the past, and that may speed up the decline.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is, in particular, gross domestic product, which will be the closest to their All Time Low level before the central bank interest rate increase.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the Deutsche Bank in 1950 after 118 Tests and lifting annual nominal GDP has only twice been less than 4%.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the year 2015 second quarter figure was 3.6%, very few people believe that standing when the third quarter has been advanced by 1.5%, tells The Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.</seg>
<seg id="25">Raising interest rates in this fragile economic setting, it may be risky, and raises the question of, "is it different this time," Deutsche Bank said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants are prepared for the central bank increase throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting of the committee, which ends on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and economic experts believe that the committee can accept a raise at this meeting, the futures trading anticipates only a 25% probability.</seg>
<seg id="28">"our research shows that since 1950, all upward cycle have so far appeared to increase the leverage of the super cycle, where GDP has surpassed its peak before the recession very quickly after that, when the recovery has begun," the report says.</seg>
<seg id="29">On the other hand, now under way has been exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst period of observation.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the current cycle, the central bank is by far the longest wait on record: the end of the last recession has been to 35 months, and now, is already underway. 74 months.</seg>
<seg id="31">The standard return has also been a volatile market is expected to increase the interest rate, and the model reminds me of some of the findings made in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is that the central bank changes its line, its effects are more in bonds than shares.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bond yields for the first cycle of alternating direction seems to immediately increase / surgery.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the cycle of debt yields fall immediately, "Deutsche Bank said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Charles Schwab, the strategists believe that raising interest rates causes short and long-term bond yields convergence, thus pave the yield curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">Higher fixed-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, even though "we are still cautious about the search for yield," said Schwab, a fixed income analyst Kathy Jones in an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">Surprisingly, Jones, believes that the market has already adapted to the alignment of the Central Bank's expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"the strength of the dollar and inflation expectations fall apart there are a number of signs that the market must adapt to tighter monetary policy outlook," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short term interest rates are high, the yield curve is flat, have increased credit spreads and volatility has increased - all these are specific to the market, where the central bank has tightened up their alignment.</seg>
<seg id="40">In general, companies whose business is mainly in the United States, win, when interest rates rise and the local products should be more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multinational companies, which have a lot of debt, are performing worse, when the increase in the dollar makes their products more expensive on world markets and of their debt will be more expensive than what they are funding.</seg>
<seg id="42">"history shows that" quality "shares generally are more productive after the first rate increase in three months," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies with strong turnover, passed the weak turnover companies in 1994, 1999 and 2004, after increases by an average of 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies that have a high return on capital and low volatility stocks, shares, performed better than the low quality companies. First, the average was 4 (percentage points) and the latter (3 percentage points).</seg>
<seg id="45">The debt will be a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="46">Those companies which have a lot of floating rate debt, we are losing the most, Goldman said.</seg>
<seg id="47">The stock market speculation on the outside, consumers have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers will also be able to make a profit with higher yields, even though the experts take a different view of how quickly the effect feels like.</seg>

<seg id="2">Conservative MP Andrew Bingham blames channel "popularise"</seg>
<seg id="3">He argues that its separation of commercial competitors are becoming more and more difficult</seg>
<seg id="4">In addition, he took to his target, the BBC Music Awards, prizes, saying that they only imitate the Brit awards prizes</seg>
<seg id="5">The People's Assembly colleague Damien Collins criticised the voice that is not original.</seg>
<seg id="6">BBC Radio 3 is "changing" classic fm:ksi, claims a leading representative of the production company, the increasing pressure to prove that it is doing something, where commercial production companies do not.</seg>
<seg id="7">Conservative MP Andrew Bingham said to BBC executives, too, that the public service radio station "seemed to popularise his" content, and that it is increasingly harder to distinguish from commercial competitors.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it seems to me that Radio 3 - I don't like to use the term" popularise "- classic fm:ksi is changing," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He took in sights including the BBC Music Awards Awards, which launched in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="10">"last year, I started at the BBC Music Awards seems just a different name of a set-up under the Brit Awards Gala.</seg>

<seg id="13">Radio 3 teaches such things about classical music, what I can't learn from anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its commitment to live music and the music is, in fact, first class.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in addition, I think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to find new music and commissioned new works," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel must do more work than before to reach out to the public, because the British know less about classical music.</seg>
<seg id="17">Radio 3, however, was not the only part of the BBC offer, which was criticized for a commercial competitors to step on the toes of the Culture, Media and Sport, on the special committee hearing.</seg>
<seg id="18">The conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticised The Voice, music competition, which the BBC bought from a Dutch production company Talpa Media, according to estimates by 22 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="19">Do you understand why this programme is often discussed, because it is not original and it is not unique in any way?</seg>
<seg id="20">Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 Channel programme, which act as a judge Paloma Faith and Boy George, has produced "a very BBC style."</seg>
<seg id="21">He added that he wants the production company "löytävän success of their own inside the house, "the next time, when it will start a series of entertainment.</seg>

<seg id="6">He said he "killed his wife last night," and also pointed out that the house is "a sweet dog," which "does not bother anyone," but is probably upset.</seg>
<seg id="7">Police asked the caller's name, but he didn't tell me that.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lamb did not give an explanation for the shooting.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the police got to the scene, they found the body of a 41-year-old Amy Prentiss, a 45-year-old lamb handwritten message that read: "I'm so sorry I wish I could take it back.</seg>
<seg id="10">I love Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me. "</seg>

<seg id="1">I guess David Cameron loraxin knows better than this?</seg>
<seg id="2">Every parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves a book, it won't be long before we learn that almost by heart.</seg>
<seg id="3">Except if you're David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">When holiday childcare services provided from the prime minister asked his favorite children's book, he chose Dr. Seuss book, The Lorax, published in 1971, the Environmental Protection of the story.</seg>
<seg id="5">The choice was a tough one, Cameron writes in The SuperCamps petroivoire published on the Web site message and continues: "funny, touching, creative, and contains a strong message, I enjoy my read of this book to my children, because it always seems to find a picture or message, which we have not seen before."</seg>
<seg id="6">All this is true, but the next track, which Cameron supposedly describes the plot, is a summary of the 2012 film version, which was a relatively short original fill added new characters and details.</seg>
<seg id="7">"within the walls of tarvillen town, where all nature is gone and even the world's trade goods, Ted Boy hopes to win the girl of his dreams to get to the heart of the side fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," the text says, and describes the love story, which in 1991 dead Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, you don't write.</seg>
<seg id="8">If this is not yet enough suspicious, Cameron's text in some places sounds like it was taken from the Internet Movie Database website found the Lorax movie plot summary, which begins as follows: "within the walls of the city, where everything is tarvillen artificial and even the world's trade goods, Ted Boy hopes to win his dream girl Audrey heart to their side."</seg>
<seg id="9">Taking into account the fact that Cameron has publicly active older, it seems unlikely that he would be so familiar with the plot, in which a young, unnamed boy hears how local nature is destroyed by the greedy, trees and woven tarviksia Once-ler, regardless of the name given to the story of the short, mustachioed creature of loraxista, who "speaks for the trees."</seg>
<seg id="10">Such relatively invisible public relations mission is probably outsourced to his aide, who do not appear to have ever read a book 20 times in a row for the children.</seg>
<seg id="11">The prime minister's spokesman said that the text has become about Cameron's constituency office.</seg>
<seg id="12">Supercamps confirmed that the text was from Cameron's staff, but no comments on the matter at that time any more.</seg>

<seg id="2">Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates have a tough task, but when you see what kind of Team England has chosen for the tour, I don't think the last series 3-0 loss there was a likelihood of recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="3">I wouldn't close even vierasvoittoakaan out of the equation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alastair Cook's party may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but it involves a good curveball hitters and the team mentality is strong: they don't have the scars from 2012, only the youthful positivity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moeen Ali is developing in his curveball and Adil Rashid is the attacker option, even if he is an unknown factor at this level.</seg>
<seg id="6">The subject: Adam Lyth fell out of the England cricket team, to be replaced by Alex Hales.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision leaves the team of Adam Lyth is understandably hard to analyze for me, because I'm his head coach in Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="8">His seven games have been good against the invaders in challenging circumstances, and simple but the hard truth is that cricket players are judged on their results.</seg>
<seg id="9">The selection of Joe Root, for example, there was no uncertainty before the release, because, as I have said before, the players are the best choice.</seg>
<seg id="10">About 100 points higher, and lythin era in team have been able to continue, but he was in charge of their own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">I hope if he gets more home runs, second chance comes to yorkshirelle front.</seg>
<seg id="12">England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised lythin attitude, even when he's not performed quite as well as it could have, it does not surprise me. Lyth is first and foremost a team player.</seg>
<seg id="13">It's hard to answer the question of how long the batter makes a mark on the left.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, such as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton got a chance to play at home and guests.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan trottin to Caribbean, Lyth at first when I was in top shape, but it missed the opportunity is now a thing of the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex Hales comes along, and it has a batter which I appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's a cricketer, it is something which we in Yorkshire we saw early in this season, when he made 236 points against us at Trent Bridge pitch.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to give them at least the same chance as the others before him, but this of course depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.</seg>
<seg id="20">Is juggling the idea of opening the batting in the moeenista cook right next to the airport, which can be an extra pitcher, but could keep four quick, and I'm not against this.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don't understand why no batter could hit there, and this left-hander has already shown himself to be a cricketer.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen may not do their duties in their county in worcestershiressa, but he has been to three of them, and in that there is not much difference.</seg>
<seg id="23">My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games before the first wicket fell, moved to the autopsy in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="24">He did as soon as three hundred points for not remembering the past.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari will join the team as a replacement pitcher, and, what little I have been in contact with her, she seems like a very impressive young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People can look at his beautiful, amazing statistics - batting average of 31, 35 with the ball and I think that it's a gamble, but there's not too many pitchers and young voters chose.</seg>
<seg id="27">He learned a lot on this tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">The team outside the English seems to be a few tough appendix to the side of the coach.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sri Lankan batsman Mahela jayawardenen appointment as a consultant to the games may prove to be a stroke of genius.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the nicest guys in the game, and brings with it a huge amount of experience, because it is all done in all situations and in all kinds of attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood will be included in the white ball game, and brings with it a whiff of both energy and ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="32">I've always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it be playing or coaching, and he's got the same brains as exploitable mahelalla.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes a new voice in the locker room to refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.</seg>
<seg id="34">Collyn team of guys from Durham, Ben Stokes, the rest in, given the similar rootille yksipäiväisissä to break against Australia and I do not have, at least, there's no problem with this.</seg>
<seg id="35">Although not all agree with the coaches, and chose not to do a timetable.</seg>

<seg id="2">David Cameron a half-assed uudelleenneuvottelustrategiat British in the EU should be forced from day to day, to a still larger problem, even if not taken into account even heartfelt, Jeremy, "Is that a yes or a no?" corbynin selection to the Labour Party or the leadership of the central organization of trade unions angry for Europe on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The foreigners also has its own corbyninsa and nigei faragensa.</seg>
<seg id="4">European diplomatic friend recently explained that, because the EU is so deep in the various crises, not all of which is their fault, some member states are tired of British self-centered agenda, which is full of divisive and disruptive changes in the contract concessions, which, for the most part, these countries do not want to.</seg>
<seg id="5">In its annual meeting in Brighton, the central organization of trade unions decided that it does not want them, if they are eroding social protection.</seg>
<seg id="6">We could even call it a Dave and George selfieagendaksi.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prime Minister and finance minister late on the summit or in foreign capitals held bilateral meetings, take a picture of themselves in front of the memorial to the famous local civic leader either with or without him, and then come home, saying that winning support for the reforms.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's all about me.</seg>
<seg id="9">My European friend who wants to look outwards to the British inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with the French," said the Berlin - propose that certain capitals of short-sighted ministers and officials are now in a position that they don't care about our ice and then leaving.</seg>
<seg id="10">Careful and prudent German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his post before it goes to ruin in the same way as happened for too long without delay Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and kohlille (16).</seg>
<seg id="11">The French françois-vincent hollandella is ahead of re-election or replacement in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">He, too, is out of power.</seg>
<seg id="13">The point may be nationalistic right-wing government in Spain, the leftist.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's hard to see this country sacrifice selfiebrittien for when their energy should rather redirect to prevent that, Scotland is not the source of the United Kingdom - they don't want to do the same because of it's own separatist tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">So, my friend, some of these ministers can even design deliberately useless comments to the Scottish National Party in the style of Great Britain in 2017, the referendum campaign during Brexit to speed up the process.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the renegotiation was a setup" and "uudelleenneuvotteluilla was not mean anything to Britain."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Europeans have had a bitter experience, how greedy Fleet Street press can be and how the EU dictator are skeptical of the press, which it is not in the Tony Benn inspired the 1975 referendum, when we started in 1973 as a membership was confirmed by the ratio of 2: 1.</seg>
<seg id="18">They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the biggest euro opportunist, who made a name for himself by writing about his "direct EU banana" is as a Brussels correspondent in the early Nineties.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.</seg>
<seg id="20">He belonged to a motley bunch of taxes guest rascal, phone was hacked foreigners and persons who are domiciled elsewhere in name and who own most of our big newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tony Blair actually thought of them exactly the same way, but I realized that if you are horny in a cage with the gorilla, the banana is a diversion, because if you don't want to be that of a gorilla, and later still the lunch menu at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, Miliband was blairilaisempi like Blair himself, when it comes to resisting Cameron uudelleenneuvottelutempun. Bair was in fact agreed to the principle behind the EU constitution, rejected by French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press is not given to him that either never forgive.</seg>
<seg id="24">But it's nice to Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me kindly in the back with the Westminster Parliament House on Monday (said to him that he does not have any more time to waste on me), appears to be in danger of being taken over by Neil Kinnock, the 1980s boycott Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake, and then that now.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even though it may take some time, however, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to communicate to the media, not to me, but there is no doubt that to Andrew Marr on the BBC sofa Corbyn left on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbynin official status in Europe is, to put it politely, evolving.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Well, the majority of the people of the United Kingdom Independence Party Ukip war paint and the enthusiasm of the Conservative Party in fierce nationalists outside can certainly stand behind this opinion.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Hilary Benn, but not Benn fan" Benn said this in the TV and radio this week, when his inner Boy Scout would have to admit that the choice of rugged corbynin appointed John McDonnell as the shadow government, the finance minister was a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the '70s, when his dad on TV, trying hard to be disloyal to the Labour Party without their government colleagues that without going so far as to lose the seat of government.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hillary hard were more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the battle to stay involved "in a situation where its good" - Benn phrase - wasn't that what, McDonnell said, and from the looks of it what Corbyn told peers and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.</seg>
<seg id="33">Whatever it is, it is hierarchical, emotional and personal image, the Corbyn wants to convey (remember, that he even touched me), communications, discipline is important in an era of 24-hour TV, social media, and in particular in the vortex, which is a breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.</seg>
<seg id="34">As McDonnell has said, it is only fair to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, by allowing him to keep the Labour party support in the referendum campaign for granted.</seg>
<seg id="35">Simon Jenkins seems to think so.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnell and corbynin basic circles regarding membership of the EU (and line their intellectual Benn regulated their economic and anti capitalist with the past) is no longer just a abstruse debate of left-wing dissidents on the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma of the legal bickering.</seg>
<seg id="37">When it comes to his duality about NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby siitäm campaigned his donation), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why the Paris or Berlin might want to waste political capital (they have a suspicious voters) to make concessions to Britain, when it could be completely unnecessary?</seg>
<seg id="39">The United States has been somewhat disappointed at the poor performance of the British military in Iraq, Libya and Syria, and even cut the cost of a Conservative government was in power, as we have been reminded in Monday British Influence security forum starting safety forum.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should be discontinued in programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice transmission, and that commercial competitors "antaisivat whatever "about such hits as, for example, the Albert Square Street located soap series.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programmes to which other British broadcasters do not do.</seg>
<seg id="4">From the BBC, he criticised the fact that it puts the public service programmes, which are likely to have a smaller audience, broadcasting to the tricky time against such competitors look at programs and channels, like bbc4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After that, when the BBC director general Tony Hall said the company wants to make more cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said, that he tried to Channel 4 for a period of six years to create a relationship with the BBC, to no avail.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I don't understand the idea that the BBC produces and sends programmes which will be clear to the subsidized competitors," Johnson said to the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its investigation of the BBC's future.</seg>
<seg id="7">If the holding of the licence fee - I am not sure that would be the media or the long term, a good idea - it should at least limit its production to such programmes, which the others do not and that.</seg>
<seg id="8">The voice will be sent to the most important mission for the future of the time, because it wants to gather as much support as possible.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that no one else seems to, is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I don't understand why you should be a regressive tax to finance programmes, which also could be financed without state aid.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice is one of EastEnders and the other one, admittedly, taken inside the house.</seg>
<seg id="12">Frankly, the other channels would give anything for it.</seg>
<seg id="13">I don't understand how it is a matter of public service broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think that it would weaken the BBC at all. "</seg>
<seg id="15">Channel 4:ä between 2004 and 2010 led to a serial entrepreneur, Johnson said that the BBC is guilty of viewing the hunting "targets because of the people who work there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."</seg>
<seg id="16">His comments on the BBC's most popular series like The former tech-sky leader Tony ball Comments. He used in the 2003 MacTaggart Lecture in Edinburgh to propose that the BBC sell series such as Eastenders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said that the smaller the audience, the BBC public service programmes to "menevät bbc4:lle, which is often not possible to measure the audience, but the BBC fulfils its responsibilities and may then £2.4 billion licence fee revenue in defence of hypocrisy, saying that "of course, we are doing all this unknown programmes, which no one is looking." '</seg>
<seg id="18">They put him in place to broadcasters, which no one will ever see them.</seg>
<seg id="19">The licence fee for the Johnson said to the committee: "I challenge you to find a regressive system in it, who gets the most from it's worth.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course you all think, we all think that the 150 quid a year buys a lot of value, but I don't know is it true to those people for whom £150 is a lot of money, because they do not use the BBC too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">The former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should reassess its Reith temporary mission "to inform, educate and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="22">He said that only a small part of the BBC production now classified as training - he said the figures are 1% of the TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and that it should take inspiration from Australia and Canada broadcasting and changes made to "inform, educate and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="23">When it comes to partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should concentrate more on Proms events such as concerts, which he said will be shown in a television just a few, and team up with commercial companies, so that this all should be considered in the network.</seg>

<seg id="3">Researchers have increased the worms, which have been genetically modified neural systems, so that they can control the sonic eruption.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tiny nematodes changing direction as soon as it hits the impulse, which is too high in the human ear.</seg>
<seg id="5">The electrical impulses are switched on genetically modified commercial nerve cells, in which ultrasonic waves to film channels.</seg>
<seg id="6">The subject: the researchers read and write brain activity with light</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers say that the worms of the new show, the genetics, the designated method, in which an ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body by hand.</seg>
<seg id="8">In La Jolla, California of the Salk Institute scientist Sreekanth Chalasani told the Guardian that the method could one day replace the deep brain stimulation, it's invasive procedure, in which the human brain is electrical impulses to treat Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Roundworms do not normally respond to ultrasound Chalasani, but found that, when they are surrounded by liquid, which is microscopically small bubbles, the situation changed.</seg>
<seg id="10">He found that bubbles confirmed the ultrasonic waves, which then pass the worms inside.</seg>
<seg id="11">The ultrasonic waves affect the TRP 4 4-ionikanaviin, structures, which exist in some of the worms of the cell membranes.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sound waves make these ion channels open up and activate the adherent cells, as reported in the Nature Communications journal, published the report.</seg>

<seg id="14">When I used to edit Chalasani ultrasound worms, micro bubbles confirmed the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms, which they switched on fabricated business nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="15">The method has some of the same features as optogenetiikassa, groundbreaking tools, which will give scientists the opportunity to turn the nerve cells on and off using light impulses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Chalasani said, however, that there may be some advantages to the use sonogenetiikan optogenetiikkaan compared to.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unlike light, which must be sent to optical fibre along the desired point within the brain, matalataajuuksiset ultrasonic waves can travel unhindered through the tissue, so it can be sent to the brain from the skull.</seg>
<seg id="18">"we believe that the gene therapy virus using therapeutic and it may be possible to target human nerve cells to respond to momentary ultrasonic signal in certain neurological treatment in a clinical environment," Chalasani said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Other applications could be to focus on the target muscle cells and insulin producing cells, he added.</seg>

<seg id="2">It's been 11 years since, unaware I was 19 when I moved into a student dormitory, and then you still believe in berets and moral relativism, but it is only now I remember my annoying people forced smiles - and a large number of complaints from other long.</seg>
<seg id="3">I was a big part of the learning can be summed up in eight simple rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">Amendment to the dorm could be anything for the nerves of the fair is scary.</seg>
<seg id="5">Attractiveness is Babble: tell me where you're from, like the years and where, what do you think of the Corbynista, and why, "Seriously, I don't love or hate Marmite because really it's just the yeast extract hahaha I'll be in my room."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take a deep breath.</seg>
<seg id="7">And will also help other breath - ask questions and show interest.</seg>
<seg id="8">It will guide the debate and help you find those people, like, nor those who didn't want to talk about, even if your eyelashes are the fire extinguishers and they share.</seg>
<seg id="9">Give people space.</seg>
<seg id="10">People often change room for a cocktail party, movie night the place and yleiksi leisure locations, but they are also places where people dress up and her underwear.</seg>
<seg id="11">In your subject: don't even think about start university in a relationship</seg>
<seg id="12">The university is a tough place for an introvert.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your room should be a place to rest, but to many of the dorm room is made up of another wandering culture, which is a friendly, social causes and lifelong friendship.</seg>
<seg id="14">It may mean shit to someone who's trying to get some rest.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nothing in this culture does not give you permission to say, "I like you, and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now, that I can collect back energy which I spent in my conversations with you."</seg>
<seg id="16">Try to sense when a college guy is tired of socialisation - and perhaps send a text message to knock at the door instead.</seg>
<seg id="17">Of knocking when I became president: knock on the door.</seg>
<seg id="18">There was a guy in my college dormitory was of the opinion that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.</seg>
<seg id="19">He saw quite a lot of stuff.</seg>
<seg id="20">Make friends through the baking.</seg>
<seg id="21">When do you start university on the baking trend in peak periods, people knock at the door with a plate of chocolate cake and itself the presentation seems somewhat less strange, less "Welcome to the neighborhood, I made something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions from" 50 0-lukulaiselta.</seg>
<seg id="22">Itsetehtyjen treats the provision is a great way to make friends.</seg>
<seg id="23">Your partner feel obliged to talk, and it may be that they continue to associate your face to a tasty surprise.</seg>
<seg id="24">This of course depends on it, you know how to bake.</seg>
<seg id="25">Badly mixed flour Sugar Fat blobs is likely to make people just pretend to be asleep when you knock on my door.</seg>
<seg id="26">Stealing food is a common crime in the student dormitory.</seg>
<seg id="27">Understandably, some chicken stealing is stealing, but what about if you take just a drop of milk in your tea?</seg>
<seg id="28">Ask and check the milk from the owner.</seg>
<seg id="29">Is it possible that they are going to give you permission, while boiling inside.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone steals all your stuff, it's annoying and you have my sympathy - but I try to take that adults like my dorm mates which, when mixed with milk to detergent to punish those who stole it.</seg>
<seg id="31">He is now in prison.</seg>
<seg id="32">You should not make noise, so that people do not get to sleep or study.</seg>
<seg id="33">Not only are you a decent person, but because you're like the proverbial pot calling the kettle black.</seg>
<seg id="34">A girl in my hall asked his neighbors, they could they play his drum and bass music down, because at the time it was three in the morning and he had an exam in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="35">The answer was to increase the volume.</seg>
<seg id="36">When they finally stopped at 5 in the morning, she kindly gave them sleep for two hours before he put his own music, locked his door and went to kolmetuntiseen exam.</seg>
<seg id="37">Wouldn't it be romantic, if you happen to change your future spouse in the same dorm with you?</seg>
<seg id="38">Or conversely, would it not be incredibly embarrassing if like dorm mate as your future spouse, hooking up, divorced, and then to see him every day, and possibly lose all your mutual friend to him.</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, The Heart Wants What It Wants, but if the hot dorm partner is definitely not your future spouse, you could at least try and talk some sense into your head.</seg>
<seg id="40">In that exhilarating moment when you discover that someone has left his keys in his locked room, and the line between keppostelun bullying is thinner than what it seems.</seg>
<seg id="41">A good trick is nice, but it is reversible in the moment.</seg>

<seg id="2">The global economic crisis has brought to the surface of the Karl Marx (1818 1883) and his 1894 in 1867 published the work of the capital, writes the former chairman of the well-known skp:n geοrge Chevron published today of Marx's Capital topicality.</seg>
<seg id="3">"they take him seriously now than I have in a long time," Chevron writes in his preface.</seg>
<seg id="4">Marx's assessment of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and penetrate more widely to all areas of life, the concentration of capital and financial capital and an imaginary capital growing role have proved remarkably far-sighted.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the clasp of organised capital seminars based on the writer's list is also a university professor, I appreciate the talent of Sixten korkman.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the book, writes korkman Marx was timely "now and forever."</seg>
<seg id="7">I don't think the former by Business Research Institute and the business delegation to the managing director, however, is a Marxist?</seg>
<seg id="8">Oh, no, no, no.</seg>
<seg id="9">Korkman tells me on the phone that he doesn't like Marx as a timely economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now social sciences are diversified and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary expert.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the common perception is that noble history tells us about the dead men wrong opinions," korkman start.</seg>
<seg id="12">The truth is that Marx's predictions hard to go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="13">Even though Marx understood the nature and importance of the Industrial Revolution, he pulled the capitalism of the journey too far to conclusions, whether korkman.</seg>
<seg id="14">But korkman, however, sees the value in Marx's radical attitude.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Marx is relevant in that, he asked good questions," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">It will be discussed again, Marx interests such as wealth distribution.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Marx might perhaps give inspiration for anyone who wants to understand the big picture, as a result of technical upheaval in a changing world ', analyse korkman.</seg>
<seg id="18">But, in what the government ought to decide tomorrow, not of Marx's help.</seg>
<seg id="19">On his mind capitalism was a hopeless case, that I should just quit.</seg>
<seg id="20">Still, Marx believes that supports the korkmanin look.</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the '70s, Marx couldn't read," says korkman.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hate capitalism, but its even more Other."</seg>
<seg id="23">Now the debate is more diversified, and also Marx can approach without the years of ideological and political baggage.</seg>
<seg id="24">"every social scientist should get to know Marx philosophy - as well as other classics," says korkman.</seg>

<seg id="1">Friday's demonstration is in many ways exceptional - remember these strikes and demonstrations?</seg>
<seg id="2">Trade unions on Friday organized a big demonstration is in many ways an interesting and unusual.</seg>
<seg id="3">It did not, for example, found in the Finnish political history a very good reference point, says University of Jyväskylä sociology professor emeritus Martin siisiäinen.</seg>
<seg id="4">As such, it is not surprising that the trade union movement is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="5">If it doesn't do that, it would increase the government in front of the Hands Up, siisiäinen says.</seg>
<seg id="6">A very right-wing government has hit the Finnish korporatismin tradition nuclear points - and also the points which have been the Finnish welfare state for the development of important.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government of the rough to a lack of contract law.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a lot of features to the fact that the trade union movement is indeed trying to get on his knees.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time also jåmo move is a place to look in the mirror.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Mirror is needed, for example, that the move is far from jåmo all employees' support for the Friday demonstrations.</seg>

<seg id="12">From across Finland gathered unemployed people demonstrating in the parliamentary House in November 1993.</seg>
<seg id="13">If the demonstrations Friday looking for a reference point, it could be unemployed in a giant demonstration in 1993, held Thursday, puberty siisiäinen says.</seg>

<seg id="18">Besides the Power is now in the Finnish government, never very porvarinlahti siisiäinen says.</seg>
<seg id="19">The current governing coalition is still in that way, it's so interesting that a right-wing president in spite of the Finns.</seg>
<seg id="20">The last time was the old jytkyn certain elements of the Labour movement.</seg>
<seg id="21">Expected to attend on Friday, several thousand protesters.</seg>
<seg id="22">To stop the protest and also public transport and shuts down any nurseries and schools.</seg>

<seg id="25">It is across the board.</seg>
<seg id="26">Traditionally in the Finnish trade union movement rallies has been rather quiet - although the policies have, in recent years, tougher.</seg>
<seg id="27">Traditionally in the Finnish rally to avoid a conflict, we are law-abiding.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the We Need Diverse communications sipilän channels, and the prime minister's television and radio talk is one channel among others.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also such direct speaking channel is needed in the future.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is not going to stay here for the last time, Sipilä said to reporters in the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sipilä still did not want to estimate how often repeated to the prime minister's speech on television and radio.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to sipilän speeches may not always care for the future of the general channels.</seg>
<seg id="7">If other channels for reporting channels, so we'll see.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now used this evening this channel, Sipilä said.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the Finnish economy sipilän's condition is so serious that it requires television and radio speech to the public.</seg>
<seg id="10">This set of issues, what we are talking about now, is quite complicated and requires a long argument.</seg>
<seg id="11">That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä explained.</seg>
<seg id="12">The speech will be sent at 21.05: 20 in both TV1 and the Radio Finland.</seg>
<seg id="13">It can also be considered in the general arena.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sipilä takes a big risk</seg>
<seg id="15">Media researcher, hopes that no sipilän television speech tell us about the general government turning inwards.</seg>
<seg id="16">The aim is to take the public debate to define rights more firmly into their own hands and to say no to a public debate on the difficulties? considering the Stockholm University professor ANU koivunen.</seg>
<seg id="17">Reminds me of the foreign minister (Timo) Soini's recent comment that he would not comply with the media agenda and not let it define themselves.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the Democratic debate and the public in the name of hope, that these issues are not related.</seg>
<seg id="19">Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant about the sipilän notification.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would be strange if the media field does not react.</seg>
<seg id="21">Political leaders of the communication styles are not reporting things in a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="22">As the representatives of the media's role is by definition to try not to let the politicians agenda.</seg>
<seg id="23">Koivusen television speech to sipilälle is a big risk.</seg>
<seg id="24">In his speech, sipilän should bring to the table something new and special, so that the president set exceptionally high expectations are met.</seg>
<seg id="25">Today there is more of that, what we have heard already?</seg>
<seg id="26">Or will he be able to speak in a different tone, a different way or a different said, or say something new?</seg>
<seg id="27">Koivunen says that if the permit is just more of the same old, you have to wonder why such a grand gesture made on a bed and gave it an exceptional time.</seg>
<seg id="28">Too general to take this risk, in that sense, even if it is not the specific situation but a routine speech among the others.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is a danger that the general stigma for a politician or the representative of the government and the media, which is certainly not the general interests or the general line.</seg>
<seg id="30">The sipilältä Smart Move</seg>
<seg id="31">In sipilän forthcoming speech, it is also important to what Prime Minister leaves unsaid, media researcher points out.</seg>
<seg id="32">At night should be considered carefully, what Sipilä is missing and what not, says University of Jyväskylä research coordinator Homer seal.</seg>
<seg id="33">Harp says TV sipilältä speech is the smart move, because this is how this is going to bring their own vision to the gravel without raised voices.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is a message to the general public without the journalistic filter, contrary to what the press conference, where journalists can ask critical questions.</seg>
<seg id="35">Sipilä bypassing the media and talk directly to the people.</seg>
<seg id="36">The danger, however, is that the media interpretation of the speech I do something wrong, because you won't let me submit specific questions.</seg>
<seg id="37">According to the seal, it is very important how Sipilä appears in TV, dripping sweat, shaking hands.</seg>
<seg id="38">He compares sipilää to father figure who now tells people what to do.</seg>
<seg id="39">If he can make his case very Sipilä, it can work.</seg>
<seg id="40">The situation is different than if the government information about something, because these people, as if talking directly to another person.</seg>
<seg id="41">This kind of (US President Barack) Obama and co are having on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="42">Truly exceptional</seg>
<seg id="43">Political scientist erkka rift to the prime minister's speech to the citizens really exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="44">According to him, that has not happened for decades, and that the prime minister is talking to the people directly.</seg>
<seg id="45">Exceptional times require exceptional means, says the rift.</seg>
<seg id="46">The investigator believes that the prime minister wants this to get in front of the Finns to receptive is blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="47">Employees' organisations organising the Friday demonstrations and strikes against the government's actions.</seg>
<seg id="48">The left-wing association chairman Paavo Arhinmäki says on Twitter that Sipilä could keep his speech on the state of the Union in the parliament as the prime minister's declaration that the president will also discuss.</seg>
<seg id="49">The SDP Chairman Antti Rinne (SD) again. To announce a challenge to sipilän dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now is not the time for the monologue.</seg>

<seg id="1">The United States is trying to tighten monetary policy following the Fed</seg>
<seg id="2">The United States following the recession begins to peak in less than a year, but the more likely within three years, after the country's central bank fed again will take a long time to raise their interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="3">And in the financial markets it's all downhill from here for themselves before the next recession.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Fed has hinted that interest rates may start as early as this week and at the latest by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">So the next recession could push her on to the next by the autumn and rattling financial markets and the exchange rate before then.</seg>
<seg id="6">Or at least that is what will happen if the world's biggest economy and the financial markets operate on it as they have been in the habit of - and if they don't respond to blackmail the Fed monetary taps as we have done before.</seg>
<seg id="7">Such conclusions have ended up German banks, Deutsche Bank London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in a comprehensive long-term market and Economic Cycle Research.</seg>
<seg id="8">The bank distribute more than 60 pages long term asset return study research report to its major international customers last week.</seg>
<seg id="9">Studies and reports by strategists do not pretend to know exactly when the Fed will raise its interest rates in the market or the economy, and what happens after that.</seg>
<seg id="10">Instead, they present the facts and statistics to cool its calculations of how the economy and the market are already acting to Fed interest rates during and after.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to the historical data, they look at what the economy and financial markets are now key variables in the same or another model than previous interest rates - and what the possible consequences.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is clear that the economy and financial markets are now in shaky shape to withstand higher interest rates than at any time in the past since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the beginning of the recession, maybe not years</seg>
<seg id="14">The Fed 's monetary policy and its stance of the relevant leaders have decided over the last summer and early autumn, implied that the time is getting ripe for the increase in interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="15">The first rate increase in more than nine years may come as early as this week.</seg>
<seg id="16">Will be decided over the course of Wednesday and Thursday, when the Fed board known as the FOMC meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.</seg>
<seg id="17">The last time the Fed raised the so-called Fed funds rate in June of 2006.</seg>
<seg id="18">Then ended exactly two years of relatively small but regular at a time by 0.25 percentage points to a series of interest rates, which the Fed raised its interest rate from 1.25% to 25%.</seg>
<seg id="19">The financial symptoms began in 2007 with the United States risky mortgage financing difficulties, and years later the financial crisis ripped open a global doomsday nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Great Recession came in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="21">The last time the financial markets and the real economy serious setbacks began at a slower pace than previous interest rates after the Fed has typically been the case.</seg>
<seg id="22">Similarly, trials were then hard and harsh than at any time since the 1930s depression.</seg>
<seg id="23">Deutschen strategists are sifting through some of the world's largest economies takeoffs and landings as well as financial market developments from 1950 onwards and always places since the beginning of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Fed interest rate increases and the economic and fiscal impact they make sense from the 1950s onwards.</seg>
<seg id="25">The onset of the recession is the first time since interest rates peaked at less than a year, usually for less than three years and an average of less than three and a half years.</seg>
<seg id="26">Financial markets rate increase is closed within one to two years from the start of the Federal Reserve interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Fed has alternately raised and lowered its key interest rate in the early 1950s after a dozen different cycles.</seg>
<seg id="28">Each time is different in some respects from the other, and the Times is in the review, the relatively limited, so on that basis I don't think you can conclude anything definite about the impact of the interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="29">Even strategists remind that this time, things have changed.</seg>
<seg id="30">Not just better.</seg>
<seg id="31">Interest rates too low for too long</seg>
<seg id="32">Determining the causes of the financial crisis alone does not necessarily get found guilty beyond doubt even in the decades of research work.</seg>
<seg id="33">But the three points that led to the crisis and its destructive power is quite aware of the reasons raised:</seg>
<seg id="34">1) The Fed, the euro area, the ECB and other major central banks in the world in the 21st century, held its key interest rates too low for too long.</seg>
<seg id="35">They patched up the tech bubble, and raised at the same time, the following.</seg>
<seg id="36">2) the financial and real economy in various parts of the developed over the decades, and already too large amount of debt increased from central banks, loose monetary policy in order to effect an even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="37">Born of economic history, the biggest debt bubble.</seg>
<seg id="38">3), especially in the financial economy substantially without disincentives builder crazy cheap debt financing expanded to most areas of the financial markets to economic history of the largest rate of bubbles in real estate, shares, bonds and commodities.</seg>
<seg id="39">I don't think that either a very strong argument that, in the increasingly complicated debt lever on the soaring financial markets were exceptionally dangerous and unstable situation, when the Fed and other central banks the last time you drove up interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="40">The debt on the building, let alone the financial levers pulse-excited valuation bubbles could not bear as his time after that, when interest rates had begun and debt financing costs were turned for takeoff.</seg>
<seg id="41">The risk materialises during the financial crisis, and that was followed by the Great Recession.</seg>
<seg id="42">The higher the bubble and more debt</seg>
<seg id="43">Deutschen strategists not to speculate about what happens next, but give tuumailun subject mentioning, for example, the following points:</seg>
<seg id="44">1) The Fed and other major central banks are now kept its monetary policy stance still light on even longer than before the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="45">If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they are now even longer still lower.</seg>
<seg id="46">2) the debt is not for a long time been a crazy cheap, like 10 years ago, but now its cheap money as debt is literally cheaper than free.</seg>
<seg id="47">So the financial and real economy debt load is not less, but in different parts of the economy now churning a lot heavier debt load than before the financial crisis, or for that matter at any time in the past.</seg>
<seg id="48">3) The more torrential and cheap central bank liquidity left in circulation is largely left to the financial markets and get the main securities and asset classes to their most expensive since before the peak of the financial crisis, or ever.</seg>
<seg id="49">Not the only downer strategists the mood of financial markets and the warning signs, but they also point out that even the United States economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and recession in decades on the pregnant model as it has happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="50">The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.</seg>
<seg id="51">In other words, the real economy is unusually weak but equally financial market pressures and risks are incomparably higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed will begin to tighten its monetary taps tight.</seg>
<seg id="52">Maybe the French bank Societe generalen strategist Albert Edwards the future picture is not as weird as I may seem offhand.</seg>
<seg id="53">He is already a good time coaching international investors bank customers to the Fed next U-turn:</seg>
<seg id="54">First, the Fed raising interest rates, then the fiscal bubble burst - and soon the Fed is pretty run to put out the financial fires with an even higher QE raharuiskuilla.</seg>

<seg id="3">The map is a reminder that the central bank president Janet L. yellenin and his colleagues will set the nation's economic interests above all else.</seg>
<seg id="4">Congress has been calculated by the central bank to shoulder the dual responsibility: they enter the United States to maximize employment and keep prices stable.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Great Depression after central bank leaders have agreed, however, that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is this third requirement can be a key factor in the decision published on Thursday, which is so tight that it cannot even be predicted. Decision on whether it is the U.S. economy ready to weaned on record, which at the end of the year incentives until 2008 to almost nil in short-term interest rates has brought.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even though most of the data shows the economy growing strongly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have already done in advance, is wary of the central bank officials more jumpy when it comes to increasing volatility. Fear of how the impact if the federal funds rate to the reference value even lift a quarter percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"understandably, the labour market and inflation is the first and most important aspects which are monitored," says Lindsey M. Piegza, a brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co, the main economic expert.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I do believe, however, that if they were looking for a justification to leave interest rates unchanged, the increased uncertainty in the global market has enough valid grounds still waiting," he says.</seg>
<seg id="10">The central bank decision has not reached an agreement, which it also creates nervousness in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bloomberg recent survey, about half of the economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">Financial markets now expect the central bank to delay the drawdown as key indicators of the opportunity for growth is only around 30%.</seg>
<seg id="13">This points to a stock market decline, if the central bank raises the level, if not policy makers, then work to soften the blow by promising that the next increase will not happen in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index rose 228, 89 points, or 1.4 per cent, the new chapter is 16 599, 85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The recovery brought with them the expectation that the central bank keeps rate unchanged this week, says John Lonski, Moody's capital markets research group -rymän main economic expert.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it is surprising, if the central bank raises interest rates right now," he says.</seg>
<seg id="17">If policymakers raise interest rates, "they have to see a lot of trouble in its guidelines to support the financial markets so that they do not to panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Some experts argue that the increased level of reassuring the financial markets, because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the central bank operates.</seg>
<seg id="19">Only a month ago, it seemed that the central bank should be in this month to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, taking the first small step toward monetary tightening, which certifies the slow recovery, the stability of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen has stated in the spring and early summer, that he expected the level to rise this year, despite the fact that the Liberals in their appeal more economic development.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even though the new job creation slowed in August, job growth has been stable this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1%, which is the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level the central bank considers the full limit.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage growth has shown signs of cheer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even though inflation is still below the central bank's 2% annual target, the central bank policy makers, the main reason for this is significantly deepening the impact of oil prices temporary.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the economy can handle larger than the interest rate level and also needs them, taking into account the tough situation of the labour market," says Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics in a company's financial expert.</seg>
<seg id="26">Financial markets around the world, however, upset last week when China devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones Industrial Average index fell by up to 16 per cent from its May record, as investors feared the slowdown of the Chinese economy, but also to slow global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the peak in May.</seg>
<seg id="29">Central bank policy makers to market turmoil is an additional element in the complex equation that tells when interest rates should be increased.</seg>
<seg id="30">"without these financial market events of recent weeks and the news on China's economic weakness, policy makers tighten the level at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Zima UCLA Center for Real Estate Agency special investigator and former central bank officials.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now he predicts that policymakers are waiting for at least a month to get a better understanding of the effects.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the possible consequences for the US economy are still very unclear, and they don't have too much information at their disposal when it comes to China, the consequences of the events," Oliner said.</seg>
<seg id="33">International economic welfare is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the practice of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank has come, however, the world monetary authority.</seg>
<seg id="35">In recent years, the central bank's influence is enormous.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 2013, the then chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, the implication that the central bank may "narrow" the increase in the number of money, that caused the upheaval in markets around the world.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world in which the markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected to not only following developments elsewhere, also consult other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy.</seg>

<seg id="41">The Asian financial crisis caused it, that the central bank cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points in the three meetings to get to and from, "despite its limited aid, identifiable by the impact of the US economic growth," Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, the central bank lifted these cuts.</seg>
<seg id="43">The central bank should put economic stability at the forefront as the only big during the crisis, such as when the market crashed in 2008, "said Adam S. Posen, the Bank of England (Bank of England interest rate determining committee former member.</seg>

<seg id="2">New research shows moderately obese patients with type 2 diabetes benefits of weight-loss surgery can last for at least five years.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, it is still too early to say whether live this mildly obese diabetic diet after surgery for a longer time than those who are treated in other ways, like surgery.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the mortality data takes a long time," Dr. Robin Blackstone, notes, he is an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery periodicals.</seg>
<seg id="5">Weight reduction, i.e. bariatrisissa in surgery, the use of different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">They reduce the sense of hunger and limit the absorption of food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years, bariatriset cuts has been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the vast majority of the persons involved in the investigation has been morbidly obese, and their body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, a ratio of weight to height is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24, 9.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person's BMI is over 30, he is considered to be obese.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate your own bmi:si here: 1.usa nhsda.htm 1D0ZqDv. /</seg>
<seg id="11">This new research, scientists at taiwanilaisessa Min Sheng General Hospital hospital used data collected from 2007 onwards to compare two types of surgery bariatrista, gastric bypass surgery and gastric reduction, type 2 diabetes, medicinal treatment for people who were moderately obese.</seg>
<seg id="12">The investigation showed that staff cuts, the average BMI fell to 31 24,56 5 by the end of the fifth year.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, those who were treated by means other than surgery, BMI remained broadly the same at 29.</seg>
<seg id="14">The street person completely cured of diabetes by 36% and 28% in part.</seg>
<seg id="15">For comparison, diabetes medicines in the treated group recovered completely by just 1% and partly about 2%.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL kolestori "were generally better surgical group," the authors said.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers also followed a patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over the long term.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hemoglobin A1c value should remain in less than 7%, the researchers write.</seg>
<seg id="19">Post-operative hemoglobin A1c levels fell from about 9% to around 6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the medicinal treatment groups, however, it remained stable at around 8%.</seg>
<seg id="21">This better "glykeeminen 'control, which improved hemoglobin A1c levels represent, does not reduce mortality over a period of five years, says lead researcher Dr. Chih Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared the average results of two different type of intersection between.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the fifth year, when compared to the stomach reduction surgery group, fermented in the gastric bypass group had been lost more weight (18, 7 and 14, 2 kg), the more their Body Mass Index (7, 4, and 5, 1), decreased their hemoglobin A1c levels (more than 3%, and 2%), and was more likely to achieve a complete remission from diabetes (46, 9% and 16%).</seg>
<seg id="24">The University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix Blackstone, says that, although the research does not show survival or surgery, after five years, there is a research results from Sweden, where the surgery led to longer life in heavier people.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Swedish study, it was found that weight-loss surgery go excess fat was 29 per cent less likely to die in a 15 year period, compared to a group that had tried traditional methods of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although the new study does not show improvement in the survival of patients undergoing surgery, Blackstone says, however, that the results are encouraging for people with a BMI of less than 35 and who are interested in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the results of the research are crucial right there, that they show that the surgery is safe for the lower body mass index" group, and is not linked to a rise in the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should be the weight to be taken very seriously at that stage, when the patient is a BMI between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think we wait too long before taking this seriously," he says.</seg>
<seg id="30">I believe that when a person is collecting these genetic changes, which permanently prepared his body to obesity and diabetes, the situation is very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="2">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised two NRL rugbyliigan champion favorite claims that his team tackles were part of "The Line."</seg>
<seg id="3">Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referee allowed storm "wrestling" with his own side, when it unexpectedly won the final screening in Sydney on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett could barely conceal his reference to stormiin after it won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night at the final screening of Bennett called the game of rugby league "näyteikkunaksi "and said that two of the Queensland team is" very enthusiastic "about wrestling.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy defended his team tackles and said that they only focus on the "Contact" tackle.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added that his trust in the two leading coach of the storm of criticism, because it means that they are afraid of losing to the team.</seg>
<seg id="7">"this will always be heard - not to mention Trent Robinson talking about wrestling, when we lost to them 24 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defense system and our technology all year in the last six weeks have only highlighted the contact in the tackle, and it has made us successful.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent has been on the team for three years, and he is obviously a great team to coach, so he is probably not used to losing, and so this was a shock to him.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's funny how it always comes up this time of year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy and Bennett challenged the idea of "exciting" rugby by reminding his mentor that Bennett was coaching the St George Illawarra Dragons won the title in 2010, playing "boring."</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne talks about the exciting rugby.</seg>
<seg id="13">He regarded as important to compare its Saturday night game to our game on Friday night and tell you how exciting their game was, "Bellamy said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember how the 2010 St George was criticized often, it is that it is a boring team, and Wayne said that he could not care less.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team who can play that kind of rugby, which we think is exciting, especially when he has a fast young guys.</seg>
<seg id="16">I like that you want to play, when you have that type of players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He brought it out of the 2010, but now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not in every team has guys like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, in order to play that way.</seg>
<seg id="18">I'm going to be confident, when they say things like this, because they are a little bit worried about playing against us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago, they probably don't think of me as a resistor in important games.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also pointed out that the storm and the game was between roostersien in richer than the Broncos and Cowboys between played.</seg>
<seg id="21">Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 12? 16</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game was 20 to 18, so we had two goals, but is it more exciting rugby?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or make it more exciting line of defence the infringement and the goal not to do?</seg>
<seg id="24">To me this is a matter of policy.</seg>
<seg id="25">If they mentioned me, it means that at some point we can play against them.</seg>
<seg id="26">The stormilla has this weekend off, because they have already won the right to a home game either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla sharkseja against next Saturday night in the preliminary finals in dinfast Park. Tickets go on sale next Tuesday morning.</seg>

<seg id="14">Look at the broader picture of Arsenal season 2007 / 08, after six seasons of the eight, it's been one of those Premier League teams who have lost the most days to injury.</seg>

<seg id="6">In a recent study was accompanied by more than 2,000 middle school and high school aged students who showed symptoms of depression, according to a study of the person the chance to recover doubled, if high enough percentage of his friend was a "sound mind."</seg>
<seg id="7">The same with those who were not depressed, the appearance of possible mental health problems likely halved, if they had a mentally healthy friends.</seg>
<seg id="8">But if the friendship could work, it needs to be available first.</seg>
<seg id="9">This social media via the communication style goes over and the contents of the time the answer is imminent is often more important than meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital life, we have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, although in reality the isolation dominates.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success are dominated by values, which psychologists call ecais: money, social status, image, and all this is done in the internal values - the desire for personal growth and friendship - at the expense of the deep impact on our mental health.</seg>
<seg id="12">As the video game developer and billionaire explained recently, the money certainly does not receive greater happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">The beauty of the friends was just that, that the focus turned this on its head.</seg>
<seg id="14">One character is not defined in their work, but even more of their personalities, which stood out clearly to interact as a friend.</seg>
<seg id="15">Joey and Chandler many hugs, moments in a comfortable chair watching football, Ross, Miss Rachel - this humor came from the knowledge that, yes, men can relate to all of this, even though they often are reluctant to explore his feelings completely.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Samaritans xaki' volunteer ...kuunnellessani explained to me: "people who are depressed and suicidal, I'm so understand how the slightest interaction with a friend may improve the conditions."</seg>
<seg id="17">Often contact us take men feel that they cannot talk to friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old adage about getting "than" is a strong, as well as the feeling that if it is open about the problems, I'll see you as weak.</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I'm trying to offer long-term coping mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="20">It highlighted the friendship between men of small moments.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even if an impartial, outside the station on the other end of the phone to help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from close, personal family and network of friends.</seg>

<seg id="16">But no other team offered on the offensive side of little other than Nikola djurdjicin Shot. 34 minutes, which went from barely past Kevin Trapp goalpost.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, PSG had sometimes lost in a lot of trouble and bad finishing pitches for particular ibrahimovicilta, which failed in a total of only five companies in the first half and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball into touch in the second half ibrahimovicin as soon as the beginning of time.</seg>

<seg id="19">The second goal finally came an hour after the game, his sixth goal of the season hit uruguaylaisen Cavan because after that, when Ibrahimovic was rapped on the pass from Maxwell on the left.</seg>

<seg id="21">Malmö coach Age Hareide admitted later that the PSG is one level higher than his team. Norwegians said: "our viimeisein Champions League game was in December last year."</seg>
<seg id="22">After that, we've played only in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">Qualifying games is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="24">I take my hat off to Paris.</seg>
