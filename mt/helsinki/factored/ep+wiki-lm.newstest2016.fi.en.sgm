<seg id="1">8 income support from the time show that Donald Trump is serious about</seg>
<seg id="2">Some have tried to label him a wind pennant.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others see him as just a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">Part of the expected collapse.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although some Republicans have tried to hilata trumpia Donald out of the top of popularity polls, it is not (yet) failed.</seg>
<seg id="6">The latest national opinion poll in 11 10, Donald Trump has been a leader in the century kaksinumeroisella, and some have begun to seriously reflect on what this means for the king to appoint real estate opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="7">Election season is, of course, in its infancy.</seg>
<seg id="8">These results do not mean that the Republican candidate will probably be trumpista.</seg>
<seg id="9">Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing its lead to the rise of Herman cainille, neither of which received the support of a single state in the nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are also many reasons why it would be a problem for him in the general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">Outside groups, such as Jeb Bush's super PAC and the conservative organization Club for Growth, however, we have taken note of the persistence and begun trumpin uses its resources to his overthrow.</seg>
<seg id="12">Following the recent popularity survey results point to the fact that there is no property in the UK is only a passing phase:</seg>
<seg id="13">Trumpin suosittuus figures have made a U-turn.</seg>
<seg id="14">Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth universityn popularity polls showed that only two of the 10 Republicans welcomed the King estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">By the middle of July, the figure was 40%.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the beginning of August, the figure was 52%.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the moment, six out of 10 Republicans takes Donald trumpiin positively.</seg>
<seg id="18">About three in 10 say that they are in the negative.</seg>
<seg id="19">These figures are correct in the first case in the federal election.</seg>
<seg id="20">In quinnipiacin University poll support in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said that they have a positive attitude to trumpiin.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of Republican voters would be satisfied if trumpista should be the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the CNN / orc:n poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they were either "satisfied" or ""innostuneita if Trump is the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two in ten said that they would be "shocked" if he became a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson achieves roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% vs trumpin "innostuneita '40%).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next largest enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio at just 21%.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand 47 per cent of Republican voters are "dissatisfied" or "upset" if the establishment favourite Jeb Bush would be the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="28">Trumpin tulinen nature is not a problem for the vast majority of Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="29">Even though Donald trumpia has been criticised widely for his bombastic speeches and violations on Monday, the ABC News / Washington Post poll, 52% Republicans according to the side of the inclined voters nationally, thinks that the real estate King is the president agreed the quality of character.</seg>
<seg id="30">In quinnipiacin last week, according to a survey of the first meeting of the party held Iowa State, the figure is the same: 52% of Republicans think that the leaders agreed to trumpilla is the quality of the character.</seg>
<seg id="31">ABC / Post poll, 44%, however, thinks that his character does not lend itself to act as president, and nearly six out of ten believe that her character does not belong in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters get used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">When Republican voters think as commentators, they are of the opinion that Trump is a genuine alternative.</seg>
<seg id="34">The CNN / Time Survey shows that four out of ten orc:n trumpia should as a likely alternative to ask who will most probably be appointed for the Republican candidate.</seg>
<seg id="35">At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.</seg>
<seg id="36">Information: Republican voters julkistus has not always been at their disposal as possible bright crystal ball.</seg>
<seg id="37">During the last parliamentary term, this time in four out of 10 Republicans felt that Rick Perry will be appointed as a candidate, and only 28% in favour of the final candidates, Mitt romneyta.</seg>
<seg id="38">In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican Party voters keep trumpin credible campaign.</seg>
<seg id="39">Although Republicans endorse another candidate, Trump Win, yet almost everyone.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some commentators have pointed out that a fragmented field is likely to have contributed to the leadership, because it goes against the trumpin trumpin support is divided among several other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">Monmouth universityn in early September survey, however, showed that in a hypothetical bilateral trumpin games and almost all of the other Republican candidates, Trump gets majority support in almost all cases.</seg>
<seg id="42">He leads by 13 points, Carly fiorinaa Marco rubiota by 14 basis points, 15 basis points at walkeria, Jeb Bush by 19 basis points, as well as Rand Paul, John and Chris kasichia christietä every 33 basis points.</seg>
<seg id="43">He is Ted Cruz with equal points.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only trumpin candidate win?</seg>
<seg id="45">If he contrasts the Ben Carson, businessman win by a large margin of 18 trumpin points.</seg>
<seg id="46">Barely a majority of his supporters is Donald trumpin explained the decision.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new CBS / nyt:n poll for Tuesday shows that just over half of the profitable trumpia voters have decided to Kelle, their voice goes.</seg>
<seg id="48">The situation could of course change, no one can be absolutely sure to say that it does not ever change its mind.</seg>
<seg id="49">46% indicated that they may switch candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">In any case, the biggest trumpin competitor at the moment, is another unlikely winner, neurokirurgi Ben Carson, but the voters who said they made their decision, we are two times more likely trumpin side.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six out of 10 say that Republicans are trumpin agree with immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, two months ago Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his opening campaign speech, immigration has been at the heart of the debate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some are concerned that Latino voters trumpin bombast to drive away from the Republican Party and damaging uudelleenbrändäysyrityksiä.</seg>
<seg id="54">A study published Monday in the new ABC / Post kyselytutkimuksen according to six out of ten Republicans say IS trumpin agree with immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">So it seems that, for as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="56">Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.</seg>
<seg id="57">Donald trumpin and Ben carsonin support now covers around half of the Republican electorate, is largely due to their position outside politics.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six out of 10 Republicans said Monday's ABC / Post poll that they would prefer an external policy than a person who has experience in government.</seg>
<seg id="59">They are also angry at the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="60">Two weeks ago, Des Moines Register / bloombergin survey of Iowa showed that three out of four of Iowa Republicans is frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% is "unhappy" and 21 percent "really angry."</seg>

<seg id="11">Corbynin Owen Smith, the shadow cabinet member, told the BBC twon Newsnight programme that he had urged the Labour Party to sing the national anthem, despite the fact that he considers the Kingdom of greenhouse gases should be abolished.</seg>

<seg id="18">Corbyn's Islington North Region representative has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time nature is too asetteleva against each other and that he intends to abstain as well as for the clever sanailusta that sniping, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.</seg>
<seg id="19">Corbyn said that the shadow cabinet secretary Angela Eagle works at his stand in for question time when Corbyn is not involved - for example, when Cameron is abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues can sometimes be used to give speeches, and he has said that he approached the House of Commons in the president, John bercowia, issue.</seg>
<seg id="21">When Cameron rose to the leadership in 2005, said that he wants to move away from the sort of political theatre, which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but he later was forced to admit their failed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ever since it began to be televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important yardstick for assessing the president's judgement, his control of the House of Commons, and his position on other public representatives, although critics question time has been criticised for the fact that they have become just a caricature of who calls for far-reaching reforms.</seg>

<seg id="4">Aldi is preparing two distribution centres, as well as the first trade opening early next year in Southern and Western Australia, which is on the way up to 120 trade.

<seg id="6">Metcashin is expected to reveal more details about his defense strategy on 29 September, when this food, alcohol and iron goods wholesalers hold annual Investor Strategy days.</seg>
<seg id="7">Much is at stake, since the Southern and Western Australia account for a total of nearly 30 per cent of metcashin IGA shops area, and its profit margins are higher than those of the Eastern Länder metcashin IGA network.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Southern and Western Australian shopping visitors are notoriously parochial and iga:n dealers are in a much larger market share than in New South Wales, and victoriassa queenslandissa: more than 30% in the south and 24 percent in the west to the eastern states, compared with 14%.</seg>
<seg id="9">Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi grabbing some 5% of these two state food market within 12 months of the opening of the first movement. Turnover comes from all the players, but mainly from independent retailers.</seg>
<seg id="10">In its report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that iga:n retailers could lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million a year by the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open next year in the South West, and 25 to 30 movement, which produces 500 and 600 million dollars turnover in these areas.</seg>
<seg id="12">In food and food sales and high fixed costs, volume loss metcashin base can pay for metcashille approximately 13 million dollars profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, Metcash lost market share in eastern states to essentially aldille colesille and, although in a recent Roy Morgan research found that the customers were all loyal iga:n.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Morgan Stanley believes that metcashin food and food sales fall 3.8% in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 2015, 14% to 10.3% in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="16">Metcash has declined to respond publicly to douglassin comments.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, it is understood that members of the government have taken metcashin last week contacted douglassiin.</seg>
<seg id="18">Iga:n market share has fallen from 2010 about 18% to 14%, and profits metcashin food and business activity, which sends products to about 1200 IGA Retailer, have fallen by 43% since 2012, and this action reflects the reduction of debt financing, with sales and margins under pressure.</seg>

<seg id="2">For Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit, rather than criticism of the behaviour</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis has been hit as bystanders in the recent storm, which has been raging around her friend, Nick kyrgioksen. He deserves credit rather than criticism for their own behaviour, says Tennis Australia president Steve Healy of the alliance.</seg>
<seg id="4">The name of the so-called 'special KF' talented young member of the 1952 Kokkinakis had unwittingly made public a case in which Kyrgios Stan irritated wawrinkaa Montreal Masters in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="5">Soon thereafter, the qualification match in tulisessa cincinnatissa chief judge had to dismiss kokkinakisin twice and his opponent Ryan Harrison, when Harrison said: 'we should have beaten wawrinkan Kyrgios, and I should have beaten those kids. "</seg>
<seg id="6">While Kokkinakis was seen most recently dissolved his bat after kramppi spoiled his potential profits from Richard gasquetista openissa Healy in the U.S., has been a staunch defender of kokkinakisin.</seg>
<seg id="7">Right now nuorimies is in Glasgow to compete with Sam grothin from another location in kaksinpeleissä Bernard tomicin with reaching the Davis Cup finals against the British.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I am quite strongly believe that Thanasi has only drawn into rähinään," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He broke his bat in the U.S. because of their lost krampin openissa, but he is not the first player who breaks his bat in frustration, and I feel I know thanasin well enough that he is not proud of it.</seg>
<seg id="10">But he has behaved extremely well, even in fairly provocative situations in the U.S. with openissa Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves the praise.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has a great team around, he has a wonderful family around, and I think they have been treated a little more harshly.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is very mature for a 19-year-old, he works hard to fit into the team and so forth, and he does not have and never had problems with the other players with him in the costume room, he valued practise hard, are in good condition and is very calm and mature nuorimies and in my opinion, they should be evaluated on its merits.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy has also supported the decision not to take the start on Friday, according to kyrgiosta important game described this "a joint decision" a good solution for everyone, but I still support the return of the Vaki canberralaisen team equipment.</seg>
<seg id="14">"we want the team to be fully focused on the game and not all the controversy surrounding [kyrgiosin]," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="15">And Nick has really gone up quickly, such as, for example, Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he was growing up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all they get kritisismin. However, we are trying to support him, try to help them understand the consequences of its actions, and I believe that it is best for him and the team that, if he were to spend some time away from the public domain, but consider these effects.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the 2016 election: according to a national poll, Hillary Clinton leading Bernie sandersiin side has narrowed the</seg>
<seg id="2">The former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, will continue at the head of the Democrats' nomination kaksinumeroisessa games, but Senator Bernie Sanders catch up to him.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now supports the 47% of the electorate (Democrats dropped from 58%), and the second is sandersia support has risen from 27 per cent (17%).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced that he will leave, according to the president of the games, but he was worth 15 per cent of Democrat voters.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before the start of the primaries, the majority of Democrat voters said that it is still too early to say that they had decided who to vote for.</seg>
<seg id="6">Clinton supporters are standing behind their own choice but more strictly than supporters of the other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton's popularity has declined by several groups in connection with last month's CBS News poll after poll, and at the same time, Sanders has risen somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton is firmly in charge of women and moderates, but his lead has narrowed.</seg>
<seg id="9">His popularity among men has declined dramatically, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's head start in less than 50 years of age within the electorate, Democrats lost, and he is now with sandersin levels.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, Clinton leads among older voters clearly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton led by double figures the Liberals sandersia numeroisella on, but now that Sanders is leading that group by 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of the country's Democrats that voters say they support Clinton enthusiastically, if he becomes the party nominee.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter say they support him with reservations, and 15 percent would support him only because he is a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six percent did not support him at all.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is hardly surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be enthusiastic in his support.</seg>
<seg id="17">Opinions are mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton, only a quarter would support him enthusiastically.</seg>
<seg id="18">In what Democrats, 48% of voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the Republicans, the same Donald ykkös trumpista says fewer Republican voters (35%).</seg>
<seg id="19">When Clinton supporters were asked in an open question why they want him as a candidate, the most popular answer was that he has the right experience (16%), and then popular answer is that now is the right time for a female president (13%) and the fact that he is the best candidate for the job (10%).</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton supporters have mentioned his links with Bill Clinton (9%).</seg>
<seg id="21">The same opinions as well as the possibility of being elected was also mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="22">Because the vice president seems to be a possible presidential candidate, and 57% of Democrat voters want to see him already participate in the games - even if it is a third disagree.</seg>
<seg id="23">Democrats ask voters who they would choose for the party nomination, Biden is the second most popular choice.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among Clinton supporters, more than half said that they would choose bidenin, which is far more popular than Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">If Biden decides not to pursue the candidacy of Democrats, Hilary Clinton leadership of sandersista grows. If Biden is leaving the board, is 20 percentage points, but if they opt out, the figure is 30.</seg>
<seg id="26">55% of Democrat voters believes that the clintonilla is best placed to win the presidential elections, but this figure is, however, down from 78% last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">By this yardstick Biden falls short, but the proportion of those who voted for him has grown.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Democrats voters asked what is most important in a candidate, however, they also raised opinions äänestettävyyden ahead.</seg>
<seg id="29">Also last month, anyone Democrat candidate or potential candidate was not considered as unacceptable as a candidate for this electorate.</seg>
<seg id="30">Democrats candidates or potential candidates fare well in some key issues among their party's voters.</seg>
<seg id="31">The majority of Clinton, as well as keep sandersia bidenia as honest, trustworthy and a strong leader.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden faring the best trio in honesty, while Clinton is strength of leadership.</seg>
<seg id="33">30% of voters say that the Democrats do not consider Clinton honest and trustworthy, which is more than twice as much than sandersista (15%), while 27 percent say that they have no opinion about sandersista.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democrat voters are also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically agree with.</seg>
<seg id="35">When you look at all these issues, around a quarter of the Democrat voters say that they have no opinion about sandersista.</seg>
<seg id="36">Although its Hillary Clinton personal e-mail addresses and servers use him as foreign minister raises more questions, the vast majority of the Democrat voters are satisfied with his explanation of the issue and says that this does not affect their public opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the matter is different, if you look at America as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, and only around a third are satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">Public opinion was divided in March, soon after the matter came to light.</seg>
<seg id="40">The vast majority of Americans say that the email controversy will not affect their overall opinion clintonista, although 36 percent said that their opinion of him has deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="41">More than six out of 10 Republicans said that his opinion on the clintonista has changed for the worse.</seg>
<seg id="42">Even though Clinton's own party voters consider him honest and trustworthy, and that is a problem for him, but for all registered voters, only 32% to keep him honest and trustworthy, and that number has dropped 8 percentage points from last month, as well as 15 percentage points since May.</seg>
<seg id="43">62% of registered voters say that Clinton is not honest and trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters in the country as a whole nor should trumpia honest and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="45">Clinton, as well as that, however, is seen as a good leader trumpia.</seg>
<seg id="46">The study involved the six Bachelor bidenia carsonia, and Bush is considered to be the most honest.</seg>
<seg id="47">Sandersia considered to be honest, as a rule, but many do not have an opinion about him, just as no carsonistakaan.</seg>

<seg id="1">This is what happens, when the US central bank to raise interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">Raising interest rates, and rising market rates fall, bond yields will rise and the economic recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">This we know.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we do not know is how long this all will go or how long it lasts.</seg>
<seg id="5">The past does little to aid the timing when it comes to the economy.</seg>
<seg id="6">The recession has lasted just one day after the first increase in 11 months, sometimes it goes so long as 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The US central bank's aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often, though not always, the defining factor in how the economic and financial resources to react.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is why the US central bank officials have been so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on that, because the interest rates start to rise, but rather go to the normalisation of the situation in the long term trajectory.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are indeed a number of variables in the equation.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the end, however, the participants in the market can see that all interest rates associated with hössötys has been excessive.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the central bank's first increase since the global economic crisis is bound to be interpreted in some circles in the era of" cheap money "closed", said Capital Economics chief global economic affairs specialist Julian Jessop in a message to clients.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, we do not expect that US interest rates gradually return to normal, even though the level is still low, a radical shock that many seem to fear.</seg>
<seg id="13">This does not mean, however, that it would have consequences.</seg>
<seg id="14">Below is an overview of how some sectors of the economy are going to react in the light of these developments, earlier:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market has seen in the last month about raising interest rates, waiting can make the situation unstable.</seg>
<seg id="16">When the increase comes from the fact that the effect has not been quite so dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"it appears that the return on capital has a tendency to pause for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which might reflect a delay in the monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent research about what happens after the increase in the central bank.</seg>
<seg id="18">To be more precise, over the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, at around 14% rise when approached, an increase of 250 days since then, the situation has been fairly steady rise in average (2.6%), and normality is reached 500 days after the average yield is six in the last cycle, 14.4 percent, are told in the Nuveen Asset Management firms leading Capital strategy Bob Dollin, a recent analysis published in the journal Barron's.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche Bank, according to the impact on equities is usually clear upward at a later stage in the cycle, when profits start to fall.</seg>
<seg id="20">The recession is part of economic life, but raising interest rates often encourage their entry.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current situation, the central bank is facing a number of challenges that have not previously been the case, and that could speed up a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is especially the gross domestic product, which will be closest to its all time low level before the central bank interest rate increase.</seg>
<seg id="23">At Deutsche Bank, according to the 1950 after 118 nominal annual increases in GDP has only twice been below 4.5%.</seg>
<seg id="24">While the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6%, few believed it permanent when the third quarter has proceeded at 1.5%, says Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.</seg>
<seg id="25">Interest rates at such a fragile economic situation can be risky, and raises the question of whether "This Time Is Different," Deutsche Bank said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants are prepared for the central bank to increase throughout the year, and we are all waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and economic experts believe that the committee could approve the increase at this meeting, the futures trading foresees only a 25% probability.</seg>
<seg id="28">"our research shows that, in 1950, since all the upward cycle have so far occurred to increase the leverage effect of a super cycle, where GDP has overtaken their peak levels before the recession very quickly once the recovery has begun," the report says.</seg>
<seg id="29">On the other hand, now under way has been exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst period of observation.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the current cycle the central bank has waited the longest by far since the end of the last recession: there have been record for 35 months, and now under way is already 74 months..</seg>
<seg id="31">The fixed return is also a volatile market until interest rates increase, and the model is reminiscent of some of the capital the findings.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is that the central bank changed its line, its effects can be seen more in bonds than shares.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bonds yields trend seems to be that changes immediately in the first cycle of increases / cuts.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the upward cycle of government bonds yields will fall immediately, "said Deutche Bank.</seg>
<seg id="35">Charles Schwab, the strategists believe that raising interest rates leads to long and short-term bond yields closer together, thus offset yield curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">High tuottoiset bonds often yield better in such a situation, "although we are still cautious about the search for yield," said Schwab, a fixed income analyst Kathy Jones at one analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to central bank policy expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"the dollar's strength and falling inflation expectations, but there are a number of signs that the market has adapted a tighter monetary policy outlook," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short-term interest rates are still high, the yield curve has been steady, and credit margins have increased and volatility has risen - all of that is characteristic of the market at a time when the central bank has tightened its guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="40">In general, companies whose business is mainly in the United States, as the winners when interest rates rise and the local products will become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multinational companies which have a lot of debt, and perform less well when the rise in the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and on their debt will be more expensive than what they are funding.</seg>
<seg id="42">"history shows that 'quality' shares generally are as lucrative as the first rise in interest rates after three months," Goldman Sachs analysts told clients in a report aimed at.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies which have a strong turnover, bypassing weak turnover for firms in 1994, 1999 and 2004, after increases of an average of five percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies that have high capital returns and low volatility shares, performing better than the low quality companies. The former average is 4 percentage points (3) and the latter (percentage points).</seg>
<seg id="45">The debt will be a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="46">Those companies that have a lot of debt, and most are losing vaihtuvakorkoista, Goldman said.</seg>
<seg id="47">Stock market speculation on the outside, consumers will have the opportunity to benefit from the rising value of the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers will also be able to make a profit as a result of higher profits, although experts have disagreed on how quickly felt.</seg>

<seg id="2">Every parent learns quickly to something: if your child loves something, it will not be long before we learn it almost by heart.</seg>
<seg id="3">But then, if you are David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">When the holiday time offering childcare services, asked the prime minister for his favourite children's books, he chose the book Dr seussin Lorax, published in 1971, the story of environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="5">The choice was a difficult one, Cameron writes in the message, which was published on the website of the company SuperCamps and continues: "funny, emotional, creative and contains a strong message and I enjoyed when I read this book to my children, because they feel there will always be a picture or message, which we have not seen in the past."</seg>
<seg id="6">All this is true, but the following paragraph, which Cameron allegedly described the plot, is a summary of the 2012 film version, in which relatively short of the original filling was the addition of new characters and details.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the walls inside the city where everyone is tarvillen nature is lost, and even the air is a commodity, Ted's son is hoping to win the heart of his dream girl, winning the right to see the wish fulfilling tree audreyn ', the text says, and describes the love story, which in 1991 killed Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, not written.</seg>
<seg id="8">If this is not enough, I suspect Cameron text sometimes sounds as if it were taken from the Internet Movie Database website found Lorax film plot summary, which begins as follows: "the wall is within the city where everyone is tarvillen artificial and even the air is a commodity, Ted's son is hoping to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey, to their side."</seg>
<seg id="9">In view of the fact that Cameron has publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he is so familiar with the plot, in which an anonymous young boy hears how he has destroyed the local natural predatory, trees felled and woven tarviksia kerskanen, regardless of the name of the short story, about which creatures viiksekkäästä loraxista "speaks for the trees."</seg>
<seg id="10">Such relatively invisible PR task will probably be to outsource assistants who apparently has never read books 20 times in a row for the children.</seg>

<seg id="4">Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but it is part of good spiral lyöjiä and team mentality is strong: they do not have the scars from 2012, only youthful positiivisuutta.</seg>

<seg id="6">The subject: Adam Lyth fall of the English cricket team, in his place comes Alex Hales</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to leave the team of Adam Lyth is understandably difficult to analyse for me, because i am her main coach at Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="8">His seven games have been good against aggressors in challenging circumstances, and simple but the harsh reality is that cricketers will be judged on the basis of their results.</seg>
<seg id="9">The choice of Joe rootin for example, there was no uncertainty before the release, because, as I have said before, the players are the best choice.</seg>
<seg id="10">Around 100 basis points more, and lythin era in team have been able to continue, but they themselves are responsible for their own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hopefully if he gets more for the race, will be given a second chance to yorkshirelle.</seg>
<seg id="12">England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised lythin attitude even when he is not performing quite as well as we could have, and it does not surprise me. Lyth is first and foremost a team player.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is difficult to answer the question, how long will the lyöjä without trace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth was elected seven times to the team, such as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton got the chance to play at home and that guest.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only complaint is that the English chose Jonathan trottin to first Caribbean, Lyth was in top form, but it missed the chance is now a thing of the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex Hales comes in, and it has been lyöjä whom I greatly respect.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is as cricketers it is something which we in Yorkshire we saw early in this period, when he took 236 points against us at Trent Bridge pitch.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must be given at least the same opportunities as the others before him, but this of course depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea has been bandied about in the Cook's omission moeenista opening next to the airport, get an extra syöttäjä but keep the four quick, and I am not against this.</seg>
<seg id="21">I do not understand why not lyöjä could beat the generous, and this is where the left has already shown himself to be a cricket player.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen does not necessarily done its job in his county, but he is in worcestershiressa triplets for them and it makes very little difference.</seg>
<seg id="23">My old team mates Justin Langer played their first game in the first 38 lattice fall, before moving on to the opening in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="24">He did as soon as the three hundred basis points and not looking back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a reserve, and its little syöttäjäksi, something which I have been in contact with him, he seems to be a very impressive young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People can look at his blunt statistics - beating the average of 31, with 35 of the planet - and to think that it is a game of chance, but there is not too much and as voters chose syöttäjiä Young.</seg>
<seg id="27">He learns a great deal in this tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">Team outside the English seems to be a great addition to the side of the coach.</seg>
<seg id="29">Sri Lankans Mahela lyöjän jayawardenen appointment of consultants for the games may prove to be Neron leimaukseksi.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the nice guys of the game, and brings with it a huge amount of experience, because it is all done in all situations and in all kinds of attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood will be included in the white ball game, and brings with it a whiff of that energy as well as ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="32">I have always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it be playing or training, and he has the same use than älliä mahelalla.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes new voices in the costume room will be able to refresh the team, even if their message is the same as in the past.</seg>
<seg id="34">Collyn team mates from durhamista, stokesia, Ben lepuutetaan in yksipäiväisissä, was given a similar ceasefire rootille against Australia, and I certainly have no problem with this.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even if not everyone agrees with the coach, and chose not to do with timetables.</seg>

<seg id="5">In its annual meeting in Brighton the General Confederation of Trade Unions decided that it does not want them, if they are eroding social protection.</seg>

<seg id="8">This is what this is all about me.</seg>
<seg id="9">My European friends, who wants to look outwards for Britain inside the EU tent - "do not leave us alone with the French," said the Berlin - propose that certain capitals short-sighted ministers and civil servants are now at a point that they will not pass on our ice then to leave.</seg>
<seg id="10">Moderate and cautious German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave its action before it was ruined in the same way as has happened for far too long without delay Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and kohlille (16).</seg>

<seg id="15">So, my friends, and some of these ministers will even be able to design deliberately useless comments made by the Scottish National Party in the style of Britain's 2017 referendum campaign in order to speed up the process of Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="16">"uudelleenneuvottelut was held at uudelleenneuvotteluilla story and" did not have any relevance to Britain. "</seg>
<seg id="17">The Europeans have had a bitter experience how predatory Fleet Street Press is part of the EU, and how the press are sceptical about monarchy, which it is not in the Tony Benn inspired the 1975 referendum at a time when our membership started in 1973 as a confirmation of the ratio of the ratio.</seg>
<seg id="18">They can not forget Boris Johnson hämärästi, large euro opportunists, who made a name for himself by writing about his "Banana" is as a direct the EU's Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.</seg>

<seg id="22">In fact, Miliband was Blair blairilaisempi than themselves when it comes to Cameron to oppose uudelleenneuvottelutempun. In fact, Bair had consented to the principle behind the EU constitution, despite its rejection by French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005, giving Blair a way out of the situation.</seg>

<seg id="24">But nice to Jeremy Corbyn, a gently patting me on the back of the Westminster parliament building on Monday, I said to him that he does not have any more time to waste on me), would appear to be in danger of a repeat of the 1980s, Neil Kinnock, who boycotted murdochia strategy was a mistake, both then and now.</seg>
<seg id="25">Although it may take time, however, he has been forced to develop a coherent strategy to keep contact with the media, not to me, but there is no doubt that the Andrew marriin from the BBC sofa Corbyn went on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbynin official status in Europe, it is a euphemism, evolving.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says that he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Well, the majority of the people of the United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP and the Conservative Party's war paint intoilun furious Nationalists outside can certainly stand behind this opinion.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Hilary Benn, Benn, Benn, but not a fan," said the radio and TV that this week, when his internal scouts would have liked to have to admit that the election to appoint corbynin Karski John McDonnell as the shadow government, the finance minister was a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the 1970s, when her father pappansa pinnisteli in TV is trying to be loyal to the Labour Party, his government colleagues, however, that the world would go so far as to lose its place in government.</seg>

<seg id="32">But for it to keep up the fight "in a situation where its good '- Benn utterance - is not what McDonnell said, and by all accounts what Corbyn told the peerage and elected representatives in a private meeting on Monday evening.</seg>
<seg id="33">Whatever it is, it is hierarchical, emotional and personal image that Corbyn wants to send (remember that he even related to me), the communications discipline is important in the 24-hour TV age, and especially in the vortex of social media, which is a breeding ground for persecution of misled and fraud.</seg>
<seg id="34">As McDonnell has said, it is only fair to give Cameron free tickets to Europe, by allowing him to keep the support of the Labour Party in the referendum campaign for granted.</seg>
<seg id="35">At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.</seg>
<seg id="36">But mcdonnellin corbynin and basic equivocation regarding membership of the EU (and the line is their intellectual and economic to regulate Benn anti capitalist with the past) is no longer just an abstruse debate of left-wing dissidents on the narcissism of small differences, which is a central dogma in legal squabbles.</seg>
<seg id="37">As far as his duality with regard to NATO (Tom Watson is not convinced that his campaigning in Corby siitäm extradition), foreign diplomats must just try to explain it to their superiors.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why the Paris or Berlin worth wasting political capital (they too have a sceptical voters) to make concessions to the British, when this may be completely unnecessary?</seg>
<seg id="39">The United States has been somewhat disappointed by the poor performance of the British military in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even the cost-cutting Conservative government was in power, as we were reminded on Monday night in the British Influence Security Forum, a security forum to start.</seg>

<seg id="1">The BBC would do well to abandon eastendersistä, says former Channel 4 chairman</seg>
<seg id="2">The former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should put an end to programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and the sending of commercial competitors "antaisivat whatever 'such as, for example, to hit this Albert Square Street location of soap.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used for programmes to which other British broadcasters do not do.</seg>
<seg id="4">He criticised the BBC for having to put public services under the programme, which is likely to have a smaller audience, the difficult airtime against competitors and watch such channels as bbc4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After BBC director general Tony Hall has said the company wants to make more cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that he comes to Channel 4 in the past six years to establish a relationship with the BBC, in vain.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I do not understand the idea that the BBC will produce and broadcast, which clearly suited for subsidised competitors," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">If the licence fee is maintained - I am not sure that it is for the media or in the long term, a good idea - it should at least limit their production to a programme which others do not and produce.</seg>
<seg id="8">The voicea sent to important airtime, because its future is to gather as much support as possible.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that no one else seems to, is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is clearly nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I do not understand why there is a regressive tax to fund programs that could be financed without state aid.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice, and EastEnders is one another, admittedly within a house.</seg>
<seg id="12">Frankly, other channels would give anything for it.</seg>
<seg id="13">I do not understand how it is about public service broadcasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">I do not think that this would weaken the BBC at all. "</seg>
<seg id="15">Channel 4:ä between 2004 and 2010 led to the serial entrepreneur, Johnson said, that the BBC is guilty of viewer numbers chasing 'targets because of the people who work there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support. "</seg>
<seg id="16">Their comments on the popular BBC series are reminiscent of the former leader Tony SKYN Ballin. The comments he used in 2003 MacTaggart luentonsa Edinburgh to propose that the BBC sell series such as Eastenders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said that the small audience of the BBC public service programmes for which "menevät bbc4:lle often cannot be measured in the number of viewers, but the BBC fulfils its remit and thus can then its £3.4 billion licence fee income to defence of hypocrisy, saying that "of course, we do all this unknown programmes that no one will see." '</seg>
<seg id="18">They put it to the transmission place where nobody is ever going to look at it.</seg>
<seg id="19">The licence fee on Johnson told the committee: "I challenge you to find a regressive system in it, who gets the most value for money.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course all of you think, we all think that, at a cost of £150 a year to be much value, but I do not know whether this is the case for those people for whom £150 is a lot of money, because they do not use the BBC very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">SKYN and former Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should make its interim reithin uudelleenarvioida 'inform, educate and entertain. "</seg>
<seg id="22">He said that only a small proportion of the BBC output as currently to education - he said the figure is about 1% of the TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take inspiration from the Australian and Canadian broadcasting and changes made to "inform, educate and entertain."</seg>

<seg id="2">A video showing how the worms, the shuttle to change direction as soon as the voting is taking place at its peak.</seg>
<seg id="3">Researchers have increased the genetically modified worms, which have a nervous system, so that they can manipulate the sound wave eruptions.</seg>

<seg id="7">Researchers say the new worm that indicates that a voice of genetics, the renamed method works in ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells outside of the body by hand.</seg>
<seg id="8">California at the Salk Institute in LA as a scientist Sreekanth Chalasani told the guardianille method that may one day replace deep brain stimulation, which is a measure of the invasiivinen human brain run electric impulses to treat Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shuttle worms do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that, when they are surrounded by liquid, which is a small microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.</seg>
<seg id="10">He noted that bubbles was confirmed by ultrasound waves, which then go through the worm.</seg>
<seg id="11">The ultrasonic waves affect transnational radical 4 4-ionikanaviin, structures, some of which have been in worm cells épée.</seg>

<seg id="14">When Chalasani used ultrasonic shape worm, micro bubbles confirmed the voice waves and pass them on to the worm, which they link over the shape of nerve cells in the business.</seg>
<seg id="15">The method has some of the same characteristics as optogenetiikassa, pioneering tools, which will give scientists the opportunity to link the nerve cells on and off using light impulses.</seg>
<seg id="16">Chalasani said, however, that there may be some use in sonogenetiikan optogenetiikkaan compared to the benefits.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unlike photographs, which must be sent to the optical fibre along the desired point within the brain, matalataajuuksiset ultrasonic waves can travel unimpeded through tissue, so they can be sent to the brain switches skull.</seg>
<seg id="18">"we believe that the gene therapy virus using therapeutic and it may be possible to get the people of nerve cells temporarily react to ultrasonic signals in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment," Chalasani said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The global economic crisis has brought to the surface, Karl Marx (1818) and his 1883 1867 1894 published Opus Capital, writes the former chairman of the well-known skp:n George hakanen today published a book with the timeliness of Marx's Capital.</seg>
<seg id="3">"they are taken more seriously now than in a long time," hakanen writes in his preface.</seg>
<seg id="4">Marx's assessment of the development of the capitalist economy, internationalisation and invasion ever more widely to all areas of life, the concentration of capital and financial capital and the growing role of a hypothetical Capital have proved to be a surprisingly far-sighted.</seg>
<seg id="5">The hakasen seminars organized by the capital, based on the author list, there is also the Aalto University professor, a respected economic brains Sixten korkman.</seg>
<seg id="6">The paper writes korkman Marx is out of date, "Now and Forever."</seg>
<seg id="7">Surely the former Business Research Institute, and a business delegation, the managing director, however, is a Marxist?</seg>
<seg id="8">Not after all.</seg>
<seg id="9">Korkman says on the phone that he did not consider Marx a timely economic thinker, but rather interesting social theorists.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now social sciences are differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitators and literary expert.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the usual idea is that ideologies which history tells us about the dead man's opinion" wrong korkman, begin.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is true that Marx's predictions went drastically wrong.</seg>
<seg id="13">Even though Marx understood the nature and importance of the Industrial Revolution, he withdrew from the initial journey of capitalism too far to conclusions, is considering exporting korkman.</seg>
<seg id="14">But korkman, however, sees the value in Marx's radical attitude.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the relevant Marx is that he asks good questions," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Now being discussed again even Marx of interest such as the distribution of wealth.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Marx might perhaps give inspiration to those who want to understand the big picture, as a result of technical upheaval in a changing world ', analyse korkman.</seg>
<seg id="18">But, in what the government should decide on tomorrow, not Marx do not help.</seg>
<seg id="19">They believe that capitalism is a hopeless case that should just stop.</seg>
<seg id="20">However, the study supports the view that Marx korkmanin.</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the 1970s, Marx was not able to read," says korkman.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the Maoists and Trotskyist sects hate capitalism and others, on behalf of all, but even more so to each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">Now the debate is comprehensive, and also Marx can approach the world back years of ideological and political legacy.</seg>
<seg id="24">"every society economist ought to read Marx's philosophy - as well as other classic," says korkman.</seg>

<seg id="2">Trade unions on Friday held a big demonstration is in many ways an exciting and exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="3">It does not, for example, can be found on the Finnish political history very good reference points, says professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä Martti siisiäinen.</seg>
<seg id="4">As such, it is not surprising that the trade union movement is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="5">If it does not, the government would raise it in the face, hands feet siisiäinen says.</seg>
<seg id="6">A very right-wing government has hit the Finnish nuclear korporatismin tradition - and also the points which have been of the Finnish welfare state, which are important for development.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the We Need Diverse sipilän communication channels, and the prime minister's TV and radio talk is one channel among others.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also, such a direct channel will be needed in the future.</seg>
<seg id="4">This will not be the last time that Sipilä said to reporters in the Swedish parliament.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sipilä still did not want to estimate how often repeated the prime minister's television and radio speech will be.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to sipilän speeches may not always ignored in the future in the Yle television.</seg>
<seg id="7">If the other channels are signed up for the channels, so let us see.</seg>
<seg id="8">Now this evening on these channels, Sipilä said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The state of the economy, according to the Finnish sipilän is so serious that it requires television and radio speech to the public.</seg>
<seg id="10">This set of issues, what we are talking about is quite complicated and requires a long argument.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why we ended up with these channels, Sipilä explained.</seg>
<seg id="12">The president sent at 21.05 21.20 tv1:ssä radio as well as in Finland.</seg>
<seg id="13">It can also be seen in the Yle arena.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sipilä is taking a big risk</seg>
<seg id="15">Researchers hope that the media will not tell the president about sipilän television general government inward-looking.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is an effort to take the public debate a more restrictive definition of the law into their own hands and refuse public debate deliberations? considering the Stockholm University professor ANU koivunen.</seg>
<seg id="17">Reminds one of the foreign minister (Timo) Soini recent comments that he would not comply with the media agenda and not let it define themselves.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the Democratic debate and publicity sake I hope that these issues are not related.</seg>
<seg id="19">Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant about the sipilän announcement.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would be strange if the media landscape does not react.</seg>
<seg id="21">The political powers of communication styles are not reporting things in a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="22">The media representatives, has the task of definition to try not to give the politicians agenda.</seg>
<seg id="23">Koivusen television president is a big risk for sipilälle.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sipilän should, in his speech on the table to bring something new and special, so to set extraordinarily high expectations are met.</seg>
<seg id="25">Today there is more and more what we have already heard?</seg>
<seg id="26">Or will he be able to speak in a different tone, a different way or different words, or say something new?</seg>
<seg id="27">Koivunen says that if there is just more of the same old, I have to wonder why such a great gesture by YLE and gave it in exceptional times.</seg>
<seg id="28">YLE also take this risk in that sense, even if it were not a particular situation but rather routine, among others.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is a danger that YLE stigma to politicians or the parliament, government and the media, which is certainly not the Yle public interests or the board.</seg>
<seg id="30">From clever sipilältä veto</seg>
<seg id="31">In the future, it is also important to sipilän what Prime Minister leaves unsaid, media researcher points out.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the evening, to be careful about what is missing and what not Sipilä says, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä Heikki kuutti.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to TV president sipilältä kuutin is clever, because such a veto, this will bring their own point of view with no dissenting voices.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is a message to the general public without journalistic filters, in contrast to the briefing, in which reporters can ask critical questions.</seg>
<seg id="35">Sipilä bypass the media and speak directly to the people.</seg>
<seg id="36">The danger, however, is that the media will interpret the speech wrong, because specific questions will not be present.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kuutin according to, it is very important how Sipilä appears in TV - running sweat, trembling hands.</seg>
<seg id="38">He compared the sipilää father figure who now tells people what to do.</seg>
<seg id="39">If Sipilä knows how to present their case properly, it can work.</seg>
<seg id="40">The situation is different than it was then, if the government information about something, because these people were speaking directly to another person.</seg>
<seg id="41">This kind of (US President Barack) Obama and the partners of people on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="42">Truly exceptional</seg>
<seg id="43">Political scientist erkka crevasse to the prime minister's speech to the public truly exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="44">He says that has not happened in decades, and that the prime minister will speak directly to the people.</seg>
<seg id="45">Exceptional times call for exceptional measures, crevasse says.</seg>

<seg id="1">The United States is trying to tighten monetary policy following Fed</seg>
<seg id="2">The United States, the next recession will begin its rapid, sure, but less than a year in the next three years, after the country's central bank and the Fed will raise interest rates for the first time in a long while.</seg>
<seg id="3">And the financial markets will start to rot before the next recession.</seg>
<seg id="4">It has been suggested to begin work on Fed interest rates, possibly as early as this week and no later than the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">So, the next recession will be able to print on top of their rapid until next autumn and financial market rate rytinä before then.</seg>
<seg id="6">Or at least that is what would happen if the world's largest economy and financial markets as they have been in the habit - and if they are reacting to massive monetary fedin blackmail as they have done before.</seg>
<seg id="7">Such conclusions are arrived at a German bank, Deutsche Bank London market research strategy, Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in his broader long-term economic cycles and market research.</seg>
<seg id="8">The bank distribute more than 60 pages long term asset return study research report on its big international customers last week.</seg>
<seg id="9">Studies and reports by strategists do not pretend to know when exactly the Fed will raise interest rates or what the economy and the market afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Instead, they put in the cooler for the facts and statistics to make calculations, how the economy and the market has behaved in the past to fedin raising interest rates during and after.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to the historical observations, they look at what the economy and financial markets are now key variables in the same or a different model than the previous time raising interest rates - and what might follow.</seg>
<seg id="12">It becomes clear that the economy and the financial markets are now in shaky condition to withstand rising interest rates than any time in the past since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="13">The recession may not be the beginning of the Year</seg>
<seg id="14">Fedin on monetary policy and its current leaders are tuning to last throughout the summer and early autumn insinuated that the time is ripe to start raising interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="15">The first rate increase in more than nine years, could come as early as this week.</seg>
<seg id="16">The issue will be resolved during the course of Wednesday and Thursday, when the board of the so-called fedin avomarkkinakomitea meets to decide on the matter in its meeting kaksipäiväiseen.</seg>
<seg id="17">The last time the Fed raised the so-called Fed Funds interest rates in June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="18">It ended exactly two years of relatively small but regular by 0.25 percentage point interest rates, which the Fed raised its series of interest rate from 1.25% to 25%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Financial markets oireilu began in 2007, the American housing containing the risk of financial difficulties, a year later, the financial crisis and the bursting of the global day nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Great Recession arrived in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="21">The last time the financial markets and the real economy are serious setbacks began raising interest rates more slowly than after previous fedin is typically the case.</seg>
<seg id="22">Similarly, the ordeal is just too hard and harsh than any time since the 1930s depression.</seg>
<seg id="23">Deutschen strategists are screening the world's major economies and the increases in their bills as well as financial market developments since 1950 and always in some places since the beginning of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fedin on interest rates and the economic and fiscal impact of reporting they are doing since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="25">The start of the recession has passed its rapid interest rates for the first time less than a year, mostly less than three years, and an average of less than three and a half years.</seg>
<seg id="26">The financial markets, the rate rise has been closed for two years after the start of the fedin raising interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Fed raised the floor and alternate between reduced its interest rates since the beginning of the 1950s, about a dozen different a cycle.</seg>
<seg id="28">Each time is different in some respects from the other, and the Times is in the review relatively niukalti, so they can hardly deduce anything certain about the effects of raising interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="29">Even strategists point out that, this time, a lot of things differently.</seg>
<seg id="30">Not just better.</seg>
<seg id="31">Interest rates too low for too long</seg>
<seg id="32">Determining the causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits may not necessarily be identified beyond doubt, even in the decades of research work.</seg>
<seg id="33">But the three points that led to the crisis and its destructive force increase is more or less unquestionably clear reasons:</seg>
<seg id="34">1) fed the euro zone, the ECB and other major central banks in the world in the 21st century held its interest rates too low for too long.</seg>
<seg id="35">They patch up the bubble techno track and at the same time increased the next.</seg>
<seg id="36">2) the financial and real economy in various parts of the accumulated over decades and the already excessive debt increased from central bank over lax monetary policy to impact even greater.</seg>
<seg id="37">There was the biggest debt bubble siihenastisen in economic history.</seg>
<seg id="38">3) the financialisation of the economy, especially the likimain without disincentives pakkautunut crazy cheap debt financing of the inflated to most areas of the financial markets in the biggest bubble in the history of the siihenastisen exchange of shares, property, bonds and commodities.</seg>
<seg id="39">Either there will be a very fierce controversy is hardly in that increasingly complex leverage on rising to the heights of the financial markets is an exceptionally dangerous and unstable jamassa, when the Fed and other central banks have pushed interest rates up last time.</seg>
<seg id="40">Leverage on tuned fiscal structure, let alone a valuation bubble going on than their time, since the interest rates had begun and debt financing costs were reversed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Risks materialise during the financial crisis, and this was followed by the Great Recession.</seg>
<seg id="42">A bigger bubble and more debt</seg>
<seg id="43">Deutschen strategists do not speculate what will happen next, but give tuumailun mentioned, for example, the following points:</seg>
<seg id="44">1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy still tuning the light even longer than it was before the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="45">If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they are now even longer is even lower.</seg>
<seg id="46">2) the debt is not for a long time been a crazy cheap as ten years ago, but now its quite literally cheap debt money is cheaper than free.</seg>
<seg id="47">So the financial and real economy debt load is not keventynyt but now in various parts of the economy plenty heavy lorries velloo debt than before the financial crisis, or, for that matter, at any time in the past.</seg>
<seg id="48">3) The former and a torrent of cheap central bank liquidity has gone into circulation is largely left to the financial markets and the main hilannut securities and asset types to its most expensive since the financial crisis of the previous peak, or never.</seg>
<seg id="49">Strategy not only on the financial markets in Latin mood warning signs, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and recession in decades of heavy to model than has happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="50">The eurozone economy is unlikely to recover at all.</seg>
<seg id="51">In other words, the real economy is unusually weak but equally the financial pressures and risks are incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed will start to tighten its monetary taps tight.</seg>
<seg id="52">Maybe the French bank Societe generalen strategy Albert edwardsin vision is not strange as it may seem äkkiseltään.</seg>
<seg id="53">He has been a good time to prepare for international investors to bank customers fedin next U-turn:</seg>
<seg id="54">First the Fed to raise interest rates, then the fiscal bubble burst - and soon fedin, time is short to put out financial fires in even greater QE raharuiskuilla.</seg>

<seg id="12">Tshurkin not confirmed to the press the content of the debate, but according to Ahtisaari, it is not two words.</seg>
<seg id="13">UN diplomats also refused to comment on the claims, but Ahtisaari said that al-Assad forces as early as that date made a series of massacres and key opposition groups refused any agreement that he had stayed in power.</seg>
<seg id="14">The British Foreign Office Middle East department of the former leader, Sir John Jenkins takes a hesitant president Ahtisaari, because his experience is that Russia was never prepared to discuss the fate of al-Assad.</seg>
<seg id="15">Officially, Russia has supported Al al-Assad throughout the war period.</seg>
<seg id="16">The weak point in the argument is that Ahtisaari tshurkin spoke in Moscow mandate.</seg>

<seg id="1">The US central bank policy-makers will sit for two days this week in a huge mahogany table the long-awaited meeting decided that the time has come to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="2">At the other end of the central bank, double-decker koristeellista meeting room is wall painting in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The map is a reminder that the president of the European Central Bank, Janet L. yellenin and his colleagues will set the nation's economic interests above all else.</seg>
<seg id="4">Congress has fallen to the central bank to shoulder the dual responsibility: they will be in the United States to maximize employment and keep prices stable.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Great Depression after central bank leaders have agreed, however, that there is also a third, an unwritten mandate: economic stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is this third requirement can be a decisive factor in the decision, published on Thursday, which is so tight that they cannot even predict, a decision on whether it is ready to wean the US economy from the unprecedented incentives, which at the end of the year 2008 remained in almost zero short-term interest rates has brought.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although the vast majority of the data shows the economy is growing steadily, recent turmoil in global financial markets may have already done in advance to guard against the central bank officials more säikymmiksi, with regard to the increase in volatility, how a fear of repercussions if a federal funds rate increase in the reference value of even a quarter of a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"understandably, the labour market and inflation is the first and most important issues, which will be monitored," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Stifel Nicolaus & co:n business broker prime economic expert.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I believe, however, that if they are looking for justification to leave interest rates unchanged, the increased uncertainty in global markets is a valid enough reason to expect even more," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The central bank's decision has not been reached, it creates nervousness which is already in the economy.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bloombergin a recent survey, about half of economic experts predict that an interest rate rise this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">While financial markets expect the central bank to delay an increase, as a key indicator of the potential for growth is only around 30%.</seg>
<seg id="13">This points to the drop in the stock market, if the central bank raises the level, if not policy makers, then managed to cushion the blow by promising that the next increase will not happen in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index rose 228, 89 points, 1.4%, a new chapter is 599 16, 85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The recovery brought expectations that the central bank considers the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, Moody's capital markets research group -rymän chief economic expert.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it is surprising, therefore, if the central bank to raise interest rates right now," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If policymakers raise interest rates, "they have to see a lot of trouble in its guidelines to support the financial markets so that they will not panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Some experts argue that the rising level of reassuring the financial markets, because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the central bank operates.</seg>
<seg id="19">Just a month ago, it appeared that the central bank this month to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, taking the first small step towards monetary tightening up of the state of the economy is slow, which is certified in the United States for the recovery of stability.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen has said that in the spring and early summer that he expected levels to rise this year, despite the fact that the Liberals are calling for more economic development in their complaints.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, the labour market growth has been steady this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1%, which is the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level the central bank considers the full limit.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage growth has shown signs of stimulation.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although inflation is still below the central bank's 2% annual target, the central bank, according to the makers, the main reason for this is to significantly lower the price of oil is a temporary effect.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the economy will come out of the larger and more interest-rate level also needs them given the tight situation on the labour market," says Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics company chief economic expert.</seg>
<seg id="26">Financial markets around the world, however, upset last week when China devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones Industrial Average index fell as much as 16 percent from its May record, as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy will also slow down global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the peak in May read.</seg>
<seg id="29">The central bank policymakers market turmoil has an additional element in the complex equation that says because interest rates will be raised.</seg>
<seg id="30">"without those financial market events of recent weeks and the news on China's economic weakness, policy makers tighten level at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate Research Specialist Centre and a former central bank official.</seg>
<seg id="31">He now predicts that the decision makers are waiting for at least a month to get a better idea of the impact.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the possible consequences for the American economy is still very unclear, and they do not have much information at their disposal when it comes to the consequences of what is happening in China," Oliner said.</seg>
<seg id="33">The international economic prosperity is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="34">In practice, the federal Central Bank, however, has become the world's monetary authority.</seg>
<seg id="35">In recent years, the central bank's influence has been enormous.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 2013, the then chairman, Ben S. bernanken, insinuation that the central bank will be able to reduce the increase in the number of 'Money' in the market, caused by the upheaval around the world.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world where the markets and economies are increasingly intertwined together, central bank officials are expected to not only following developments elsewhere, including other central banks and to consult experts in order to get a better picture of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science," says Zachary Karabell, a property management company, Envestnet inc:in global strategy chief.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Virginia, the federal Deputy richmondissa ntopankin (), the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank Jeffrey Lacker pointed out this month that "the central bank has, in the past, overreact to financial market movements, which have been affected is separated from economic fundamentals."</seg>
<seg id="40">The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee has called for an increase in interest rates, and Lacker, a voting member of the committee, is calling, for example, the 1998 99 decisions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Asian financial crisis, the central bank has cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points in the three meetings during the "despite its limited subsidies to identify impacts of the United States' economic growth, Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, the central bank suspended by these cuts.</seg>
<seg id="43">The central bank should put economic stability to the fore just as a major crisis, such as when the market collapsed in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, Bank of England (Bank of England) rate determining committee of former members.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latest turmoil does not come anywhere near its level, Posen said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"no one wants to see a situation where the interest rates increase because of a fear that the market 'annoyance, the Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute chairman Posen says.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Law on the central bank (the Federal Reserve Act should still include dual requirement, not to mention the economic stability, and as long as that is the case, they do not think should anticipate it.</seg>

<seg id="8">I can vouch for the fact that we have not exchanged anything in our defence system or our technology throughout the year. In the last six weeks, we have been stressing the only contact in taklauksissa, and it has led us to thrive.</seg>

<seg id="18">I will be more confident when they say such things, because they are a little bit worried about playing against us.</seg>

<seg id="16">But the team did not provide the offensive side of little other than Nikola djurdjicin shot 34 minutes, which barely went over from Kevin trappin goalposts.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, PSG has had to lurch between for missed feed-in and finalisation of a bad result, especially ibrahimovicilta which failed in all, only five companies in the first half-time and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball inside of ibrahimovicin contact right at the start of the second half.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, he was far more effective in making its case for the work of his colleagues, and that is what Di Maria sent ibrahimovicin feed-in journey spiral kick, which inclined wilandin goalposts around in the 52nd minute.</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal came at the end of the game an hour after his sixth goal of the season that hit uruguaylaisen Cavan thanks after Ibrahimovic knuckles forward from Maxwell's cross ball from the left.</seg>
