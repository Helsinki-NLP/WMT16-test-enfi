<seg id="2">Some have tried to label him as a weather vane.</seg>
<seg id="3">Some see him as just a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">Part of the wait for the next crash.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although some Republicans have tried to Deke trumpia pushes off the top of popularity polls, it is not (yet) failed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Of the 11 national polls in the last decade, Donald Trump has been leading in the 16th century kaksinumeroisella some are beginning to think seriously about what that means in terms of the potential for appointment by the King estate.</seg>
<seg id="7">Election season is, of course, still in the early stages.</seg>
<seg id="8">These results do not mean that the trumpista likely Republican candidate.</seg>
<seg id="9">Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry, has been lost to its leading position in the emerging Herman cainille, neither of which did not gain a single state in the nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are also many reasons why it would be a problem for him in the general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">Outside groups, such as Jeb Bush's super PAC and the conservative organization Club for Growth, however, we have taken note and started to use his tenacity to trumpin resources in order to topple him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Following the recent popularity survey results point to the fact that there is no property in the UK is only a passing phase:</seg>
<seg id="13">Trumpin suosittuus figures have done a complete about-turn.</seg>
<seg id="14">Just before, when Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, monmouth-class universityn popularity polls showed that only two of the 10 Republicans welcomed the King estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">In July, by the middle of the figure is 40%.</seg>
<seg id="16">In early August, the figure was 52 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="17">At the moment, six out of 10 Republicans takes Donald trumpiin positively.</seg>
<seg id="18">Around three in ten say they would take a negative view.</seg>
<seg id="19">That is true even in the first primaries of the constituent states.</seg>
<seg id="20">In quinnipiacin universities do support in a poll in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said that they welcome trumpiin.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of Republican voters will be happy if the trumpista should the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the CNN / orc:n poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they were either "satisfied" or ""innostuneita if Trump is the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two in ten said that they would be "shocked" if he becomes a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson achieves roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% vs trumpin "innostuneita '40%).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next biggest source of inspiration?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio at just 21%.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand 47 per cent of Republican voters are "dissatisfied" or "upset" if the establishment favourite Jeb Bush comes from the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="28">Trumpin nature of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is not a problem for the vast majority of Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="29">Even though Donald trumpia has been criticised widely for his histrionic speeches and insults on Monday, the ABC News / Washington Post poll show that 52% for Republicans on a national level, the voters think that it is appropriate for the president of the real estate King character.</seg>
<seg id="30">In quinnipiacin last week, according to the poll, the first meeting of the party is to host Iowa State figure remains the same: 52% of Republicans think that it is the nature of the leaders agreed to trumpilla quality.</seg>
<seg id="31">ABC / Post poll, 44%, however, thinks that it is not suited to his temperament as the president did, and almost six out of every ten is of the opinion that it is not his nature is to make it to the White House.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters get used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">When Republican voters thought as commentators, they have the idea that Trump is a genuine option.</seg>
<seg id="34">CNN / orc:n according to the poll, four out of ten had trumpia as a likely alternative to asking who probably will be appointed for a Republican candidate.</seg>
<seg id="35">At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.</seg>
<seg id="36">The data release management: voters in the Republican Party has not always been available to the possible bright crystal ball.</seg>
<seg id="37">During the last parliamentary term, this time in four out of 10 Republicans felt that Rick Perry will be appointed as a candidate, and only 28% supported the final candidate, Mitt romneyta.</seg>
<seg id="38">At any rate, this indicates that the majority of Republican Party voters consider credible trumpin campaign.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if Republicans were to back another candidate, Trump yet still win almost every one.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some commentators have pointed out that a fragmented field is likely to be because our leadership fostered trumpin trumpin against support is divided among several other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">Monmouth-class universityn in early September survey, however, showed that in a hypothetical bilateral trumpin games and almost all the other Republican candidates, Trump will achieve a large majority in almost all cases.</seg>
<seg id="42">He leads by 13 points, Carly fiorinaa Marco rubiota at 14 points, by 15 basis points to walkeria, Jeb Bush and Rand Paul with 19 points, and Chris John kasichia christietä every 33 basis points.</seg>
<seg id="43">He is at a point of Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only trumpin a winning candidate?</seg>
<seg id="45">If he contrasts the Ben Carson, businessman win by a large margin to 18 point trumpin.</seg>
<seg id="46">Barely a majority of Donald trumpin supporters have told us that they had made a decision.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new poll from CBS / nyt:n Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of trumpia voter has decided that whoever's job it is to their voice goes.</seg>
<seg id="48">The situation could of course change, no one can be absolutely sure to say that it does not ever change its mind.</seg>
<seg id="49">46% indicated that they might switch candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">In any case, the biggest trumpin competitor at the moment, is another unlikely winner, neurosurgical, Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision, are twice as likely to be trumpin side.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six out of 10 say that Republicans are trumpin agree with immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, two months ago Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign speech, immigration has been at the heart of the debate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="53">There are concerns that the trumpin bombast to drive Latino voters away from the Republican Party and damaging uudelleenbrändäysyrityksiä.</seg>
<seg id="54">A study published Monday in the new ABC / Post kyselytutkimuksen according to six out of ten Republicans say trumpin agree with immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">And so on and it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so, too, will be Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="56">Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.</seg>
<seg id="57">Donald trumpin and Ben carsonin support now covers around half of the Republican electorate is largely due to their position outside politics.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six in ten Republicans said Monday's ABC / Post poll, that they prefer to choose an outside person than a policy which is government experience.</seg>
<seg id="59">They are also angry at the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="60">Two weeks ago, IOWA Des Moines Register / bloombergin survey of Iowa showed that three of the four Iowa Republicans have grown frustrated with Republicans in Congress, with 54% is "unhappy" and 21 percent "really angry."</seg>

<seg id="2">Metcash is trying to protect against an attack from IGA Aldin business in Southern and Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Food wholesalers Metcash has launched a grass-roots campaign to defend its market share IGA dealers in Southern and Western Australia before Aldin 700 million dollars and an invasion.</seg>
<seg id="4">Aldi is preparing two distribution centres, as well as the first trade opening early next year in Southern and Western Australia, which is becoming as many as 120 trade. At the same time, Metcash IGA supermarketit and strengthen its relations with local food dealers and building brand IGA mainstream and social media marketing, as well as through events such as the Adelaide Show, through the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="5">Iga:n dealers and recruiters have to jump on board, and as a brand of ice cream manufacturer simmo's dunsborough'sta will offer us a tasting in iga:n shops and shop owners are selling discounted tickets to the Australian rules football matches to their customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Metcashin is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on 29 September, when this food, alcohol, and iron goods to wholesalers to hold annual Investor Strategy days.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is a great deal at stake, since the Southern and Western Australia account for a total of nearly 30 per cent of metcashin IGA shops area, and its profit margins are higher than those of the Eastern Länder metcashin IGA network.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Southern and Western Australian shopping visitors are notoriously parochial, and dealers will have to be in the iga:n a much larger share of the market than New South Wales, and victoriassa queenslandissa: more than 30% in the south and 24 percent in the west to the east, compared with 14%.</seg>
<seg id="9">Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi are snatched up by around 5 per cent of these two states share of the food market within 12 months of the first movement with opening up the turnover will come from all the players, but it was mainly from independent retailers.</seg>
<seg id="10">In its report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that iga:n retailers could lose $360 million a year in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million a year by the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open next year in the South West, and 25 to 30 movement, which produces 500 and 600 million dollars turnover in these areas.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the preparation of food and food sales and high fixed costs, volume loss metcashin base can pay for metcashille approximately 13 million dollars profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, Metcash lost market share in eastern states to essentially aldille colesille and, although in a recent Roy Morgan research found that customers were all loyal iga:n.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Morgan Stanley believes that metcashin food and food sales fall 3.8% in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, so that its market share will decrease from 2015, 14% to 10.3% in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week a leading investment fund manager and founder of Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass Lambert said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "may quite possibly lose in decades."</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash has declined to respond publicly to douglassin comments.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, it is understood that members of the government were taken metcashin last week contacted douglassiin.</seg>
<seg id="18">Iga:n market share has fallen from 2010 about 18% to 14%, and revenues metcashin food and the food business, which sends products to about 1200 IGA Retailer, have dropped by 43% after 2012. This is a reflection of actions to reduce the debt financing, with sales and margins under pressure.</seg>
<seg id="19">Wholesalers, however, this is done by asserting itself, and has invested each year to more than $150 million in reducing the prices of hundreds of products on a weekly basis to the same level and with the help colesin woolworthsin IGA retailers renovate shops increased more quickly, growing fresh food and bringing it to market products better range of private labels.</seg>
<seg id="20">Metcashin director Ian Morrice says that prices fall and more and more shops opening up have added to the appeal, and he hopes that the wholesalers will return to the path of growth in profit in 2017, the first time in four years.</seg>

<seg id="11">He has a great team around him, he is a wonderful family all around them, and I think he is being treated a little more harshly.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is very mature for a 19-year-old, he works hard to fit into the team and so forth, and he does not have and never had problems with the other players. He is highly regarded in a cosy compact in changing rooms, you practise so hard, he is in good condition and is very calm and mature nuorimies and in my opinion, they should be evaluated on its merits.</seg>

<seg id="11">Clinton, however, clearly leading the parents among the voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton led by double figures the Liberals sandersia followed on, but now that Sanders is leading that group by 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="13">Around half of the country's democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if he becomes the party nominee.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter say they support him with reservations, and 15% support him only because he is a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six percent did not support him at all.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is hardly surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be enthusiastic in his support.</seg>
<seg id="17">Opinions are mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton, only a quarter support him enthusiastically.</seg>
<seg id="18">In what Democrats, 48% of voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, from Republicans as the number one negotiator at the Donald trumpista fewer Republican voters say the same (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">When Clinton supporters were asked in an open question why they want him as a candidate, the most popular answer, that he has the right experience (16%), and then the most popular answer is that now is the right time for a woman president (13%) and the fact that he is the best candidate for the job (10%).</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton supporters also mentioned their links with Bill Clinton (9%).</seg>
<seg id="21">The same opinions as well as the possibility of being elected have also been mentioned.</seg>

<seg id="35">When you look at all of these issues - nearly a quarter of Democratic voters said they had no opinion about sandersista.</seg>
<seg id="36">Although Hillary Clinton's personal email address and server use him as Minister of Foreign Affairs raises more questions, the vast majority of the Democrat voters are satisfied with his explanation of this point and says that it does not affect their public opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="37">Thing is different, though, when you look at America as a whole.</seg>

<seg id="41">More than six out of 10 Republicans said that their opinion clintonista has changed for the worse.</seg>

<seg id="1">This is what happens, when the US central bank to raise interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">Raising interest rates, and rising market rates fall, bond yields will rise and the economy falls into recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">This we know.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we do not know is how long this is going to take or how long it lasts.</seg>
<seg id="5">History gives little help as far as the timing is concerned, when it comes to the economy.</seg>
<seg id="6">The advent of the recession has been going on for the first time after just 11 months; in others, we have even gone so far as to 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The aggressiveness of the US Federal Reserve in raising interest rates has often, though not always, the defining factor in how the economic and financial resources to react.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is why the American central bank officials have been so vigorously insisted that investors should not just focus on that, since interest rates begin to increase, but mostly as a normalisation to go in the long term trajectory.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are indeed a number of variables in the equation.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the end, however, the participants in the market can see that any method of raising interest rates has been exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the central bank's first increase since the global financial crisis is bound to be interpreted in some quarters as" cheap money "period closed," said Capital Economics chief global economic affairs specialist Julian Jessop in a message to clients.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, we do not expect that the United States interest rates gradually return to normal, albeit still low level, is such a radical shock that many seem to fear.</seg>
<seg id="13">This does not mean, however, that it has no impact.</seg>
<seg id="14">Below is a snapshot of how some sectors of the economy are going to react in the light of these developments, earlier:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market has seen over the past months, about raising interest rates, waiting can make the situation unstable.</seg>
<seg id="16">When the rise becomes a reality, the effect has not been quite so dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"it appears that the return on capital is a tendency to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which in turn may reflect a lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent poll about what happens after the increase of the central bank.</seg>
<seg id="18">To be more precise, over the last 35 years, the market is generally strong, at around 14% of the rise with the approach of an increase of 250 days since then, the situation has been fairly flat (on average increases of 2.6%), and normality has been achieved after 500 Days of Average Revenue of six in the last cycle, 14.4%, reported in The Nuveen Asset Management firms leading Capital strategy, Bob the doll a recent analysis, published in the journal Barron's.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche Bank, according to the impact on equities is usually a clear increase in the cycle, at a later stage when yields start to fall.</seg>
<seg id="20">The recession is part of economic life, but raising interest rates often encourage their incomes.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current situation, the central bank is faced with certain challenges, which did not previously exist, and which may accelerate the decline.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is the case, in particular the gross domestic product, which will be closest to its all time low level before the central bank raises interest rates again.</seg>
<seg id="23">In 1950, according to Deutsche Bank, which has 118 raising nominal annual GDP has only twice been below 4.5%.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the 2015 second quarter figure was 3.6%, few expect it to stay in the third quarter, and there are currently 1.5%, says Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.</seg>
<seg id="25">Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic situation can be risky and begs the question, 'is it different this time, "Deutsche Bank said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants are expecting an increase by the central bank for the whole year, and we are all waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and economic experts believe that the committee could approve the increase at this meeting, the futures trading suggests only a 25% probability.</seg>
<seg id="28">"our research shows that in 1950 onwards, all upward cycle has so far appeared to increase the leverage effect of a super cycle, where GDP has overtaken their peak levels before the recession very quickly once the recovery has begun," the report says.</seg>
<seg id="29">On the other hand, in its current form has been unusually slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst period of observation.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the current cycle of the central bank is by far the longest period of waiting for the end of the last recession: there have been record for 35 months, and now under way is already 74 months..</seg>
<seg id="31">The fixed return is also a volatile market interest rates, and while waiting for a model that bears some resemblance to that of the capital.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is that the central bank changed its line, this will be reflected more in bonds than shares.</seg>
<seg id="33">Bonds yields can immediately change direction appears to be the first in the cycle of increases / cuts.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the upward cycle of government bonds yields will fall immediately, "said Deutche Bank.</seg>
<seg id="35">Charles Schwab, the strategists believe that raising interest rates leads to long and short-term bond yields for convergence, a way to offset the yield curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">Profitable high yield bonds are often better in situations like this, although "it is still cautious about the search for yield," said Schwab, a fixed income analyst Kate Jones in an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to central bank policy expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"the dollar's strength and falling inflation expectations, but there are a number of signs that the markets have adjusted a tighter monetary policy outlook," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the short term, high interest rates, the yield curve is flat, and credit margins have increased and volatility has risen - to all of these is dictated by the market at a time when the central bank has tightened its guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="40">Generally, companies whose business will be based mostly in the United States, as the winners when interest rates rise and on local products more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multinational companies with high levels of debt, and perform less well when the recovery of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and on their debt will be more expensive than what they are funding.</seg>
<seg id="42">"history shows that 'quality' shares, which are usually in the lucrative interest rate increases after the first three months," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to its customers.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies that have a strong turnover, sideline the weak turnover for firms in 1994, 1999 and 2004 after the increase by an average of five percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with a high return on capital and the shares of low volatility, acquitted themselves better than the low quality companies. First, the average is 4 percentage points (3) and the latter (percentage points).</seg>
<seg id="45">The debt will become a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="46">Those companies that have a lot of debt at variable rates, have lost the most, Goldman said.</seg>
<seg id="47">Market speculation on the outside, consumers stand to benefit from the rising value of the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers can also turn a profit as a result of higher profits, although experts have disagreed on how quickly the impact is being felt.</seg>

<seg id="2">Every parent learns quickly to make a point: if your child loves something, it will not be long before they learned almost by heart.</seg>

<seg id="5">It was a tough choice, Cameron writes in The SuperCamps company website, and the message goes on to say, "funny, emotional, creative and sends out a very strong message. I enjoyed when I read this book to my children, because it always seems to be beyond any image or message that we have not seen before."</seg>
<seg id="6">All of this is true, but in the next paragraph, which Cameron allegedly described the plot, is a summary of the 2012 film version of the original text, which can be relatively brief written have added new characters and details.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the walls inside are tarvillen towns, where everyone has lost the natural and even air is a commodity, Ted's son is hoping to win his dream girl on the heart strings of filling audreyn hopes of seeing a real tree," the text says, and describes the love story, which in 1991 killed 'Dr Seuss, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel, not to write.</seg>
<seg id="8">If this is not yet a suspect, Cameron sounds here as if it were taken from internet movie has the website gives Lorax film plot summary, which starts with: 'within the city walls is tarvillen where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, Ted's son is hoping to win the heart of his dream girl Audrey to their side. "</seg>
<seg id="9">In view of the fact that Cameron has been publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would have been so familiar with the plot, in which an anonymous young boy hears how local natural trees have been destroyed by a greedy, beaten and woven tarviksia kerskanen, regardless of the name of the short story, about which creatures viiksekkäästä loraxista "speaks for the trees."</seg>

<seg id="3">I would not rule any vierasvoittoakaan out of the equation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but it comes with a good spiral lyöjiä and team philosophy is strong: they do not have the scars from 2012, only draw upon youthful positiivisuutta.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moeen Ali is developing in its spiral feed-in and Adil Rashid, the aggressor is the alternative, even though it is the unknown factor at this level.</seg>
<seg id="6">The subject: Adam Lyth figures of the English cricket team, will be replaced by Alex Hales</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to leave the team of Adam Lyth has been understandably difficult to analyse me, because i am her main coach at Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="8">His seven games have been good against the invader in the challenging conditions, and the simple but the sad truth is that cricketers will be judged on their results.</seg>
<seg id="9">The choice of Joe rootin for example, there was no uncertainty before the release, because, as I have said before, the players are the best choice.</seg>
<seg id="10">Around 100 points higher, and lythin era in team must be allowed to continue, but they themselves are responsible for their own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hopefully if he can get more for the special, another opportunity should arise.</seg>
<seg id="12">England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised lythin attitude even when he is not performing quite as well as we could have, and this does not surprise me. Lyth is first and foremost a team player.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is difficult to answer the question, how long will the lyöjä without trace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth was elected seven times to the team, such as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton has been given the opportunity to play at home and that guest.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only complaint is the fact that England chose Jonathan trottin, firstly to the Caribbean, Lyth was in top form, but this missed opportunity are now a thing of the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex Hales comes in, and it has been lyöjä valued.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has the capacity to be as cricketers it is something which we in Yorkshire we saw early in this period, when he took 236 points against us in the River Trent Bridge pitch.</seg>
<seg id="19">He should be given at least the same opportunity as others before them, but this of course depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea has been tossed around in the opening of the typing moeenista cook up next, when on the field, getting extra syöttäjä but keep the four quick, and I am not against this.</seg>

<seg id="24">He made three straight 100 points and not remembering things past.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a reserve, and its little syöttäjäksi, something which I have been in contact with him, he seems to be a very impressive young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People can look at his blunt statistics - average of 31, with 35 of the planet - and to think that it is a gamble, but there are not too many young people elected and the electorate is syöttäjiä.</seg>
<seg id="27">He learns a great deal in this tour.</seg>

<seg id="4">A European diplomat recently chap explained that because the EU is so deep-rooted in the various crises, some of which are not of its own making, some member states, the British are fed up with the selfish agenda that is full of divisive and disruptive changes in the contract concessions, which, for the most part, these countries do not want.</seg>
<seg id="5">In its annual meeting in Brighton the General Confederation of Trade Unions decided that it does not want them, if they are eroding social protection.</seg>
<seg id="6">We could even call it a daven and George selfieagendaksi.</seg>

<seg id="8">It is all about me.</seg>
<seg id="9">My European chap who wants to outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "do not leave us alone with the French," Berlin said, suggests that certain capitals, short-sighted, ministers and senior officials are now at a point of ignoring our ice then to leave.</seg>
<seg id="10">Moderate and cautious German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his actions, before it goes to the tainted in the same way as things went for too long without delay Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and kohlille (16).</seg>
<seg id="11">The French president, François hollandella is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">She too has power.</seg>
<seg id="13">Poland may soon be nationalistic and right-wing, left-wing government in Spain.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is difficult to see these countries make sacrifices on behalf of selfiebrittien when their energy would be better off putting it to prevent Scotland from sources within the UK - they do not want to own similar separatist trends.</seg>
<seg id="15">So, my friends, and some of these ministers will even be able to plan to do to deliberately unhelpful comments along the lines of the Scottish National Party in Britain's 2017 referendum campaign in order to speed up the process of Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="16">"uudelleenneuvottelut had been a thing," "The uudelleenneuvotteluilla may not have made any difference to Britain".</seg>
<seg id="17">In Europe we have become painfully aware of how the anxious Fleet Street Press is part of the EU, and how the press are sceptical about the monarchy, what do I say to Tony Benn inspired the 1975 referendum at a time when we started in 1973, when membership was confirmed in the ratio of the ratio.</seg>
<seg id="18">They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the bulk of Euro opportunists, who made a name for itself, write about their EU "straight banana" is as a Brussels correspondent in the early Nineties.</seg>
<seg id="19">Ed Miliband may have been silly, but at least they know who their enemy is.</seg>
<seg id="20">They will include a plethora of taxes and shunned the picaresque phones, hack into computers for foreigners and people, which will have its seat in name and elsewhere who own most of our big newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tony Blair actually think of them exactly the same way, but I realised that, if you are in the cage with the gorilla himokkaan, bananas have to move away because of the smoke and mirrors, if you do not wish to be on the agenda of this gorilla lunch and later dinner.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, Miliband was Blair blairilaisempi than themselves when it comes to Cameron uudelleenneuvottelutempun. In fact, Bair had agreed to the principle of the EU constitution rejected by French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005, giving Blair a way out of the situation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press did not give him that, too, has never forgiven.</seg>
<seg id="24">But Jeremy Corbyn, which is a nice pat on the back at me kindly Westminster parliament building on Monday, I said to him that he does not have time to waste on me), it would appear to be in danger of going back to the 1980s, Neil Kinnock, boycotted by the Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake, both then and now.</seg>
<seg id="25">Even though it may take some time, he will have no choice but to develop a coherent strategy to make contact with the media, not to me, but I have no doubt Andrew marriin from the BBC sofa Corbyn went on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbynin official status in Europe is, to put it politely - where, to develop.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says that would like us to stay in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Well, the majority of the people of the United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP, war paint and zealous pursuit of the Conservative Party furious Nationalists outside can certainly stand behind this opinion.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Hilary Benn, Benn, Benn, but not a fan," had this to say in both the radio and TV this week, when his internal scouts would have liked to have to admit that the choice between corbynin appoint John McDonnell as the shadow minister for finance is a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">That reminded me of the 1970s, when his father strained grandads on the TV trying to be loyal to the Labour party of his government colleagues, however, that the world would go so far as to lose its place in government.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hilaryn stagger is unattractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But the fight for it, that we would remain involved in "something" - like Benn - was not what McDonnell said, and by all accounts what Corbyn told the peerage and elected representatives in a private meeting on Monday evening.</seg>
<seg id="33">Regardless of what it is to be less hierarchical, emotional and personal image that Corbyn wants to send (remember that he even related to me), the discipline is important in the 24-hour TV age, especially social media, in the face of the phenomenon, which is a breeding ground for persecution of illusion and fraud.</seg>
<seg id="34">As McDonnell, has said it was only fair to give Cameron free tickets to Europe, by allowing him to keep the support of the Labour Party in the referendum campaign for granted.</seg>
<seg id="35">At least Simon Jenkins thinks so.</seg>
<seg id="36">But mcdonnellin corbynin and basic circling on membership of the EU (and the line is their intellectual regulating the economy by Benn and his anti capitalist with the past) is no longer just an abstract discussion of left-wing dissidents on the narcissism of small differences, which is a central dogma in legal squabbles.</seg>
<seg id="37">As far as his duality with regard to NATO (Tom Watson is not convinced siitäm that Corby is campaigning in their extradition), foreign diplomats must just try to explain it to their superiors.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why the Paris or Berlin worth wasting political capital (they too are sceptical voters) to make concessions to the United Kingdom, which, while it may be entirely superfluous?</seg>
<seg id="39">The United States has been somewhat disappointed with the poor performance of the British military in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even the cost-cutting Conservative government was in power, as we have been reminded in Monday's British Influence Security Forum, a security forum to start.</seg>

<seg id="8">The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine School, Martin McKee, professor of European public health, and the University of Liverpool Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology, Public Health, said: "the main principle is that the policies should be set up to prove the effectiveness."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the public expects that characterised the best argument phe:n estimates that electronic cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than conventional tobacco "is based on a detailed assessment of the evidence and the modeling.</seg>

<seg id="18">None of these links or restrictions may not, however, mention the phe:n report.</seg>

<seg id="7">If the licence fee - I am not sure that it is for these media or long term - at least it is a good idea to limit its production to such programmes, which the others do not do that.</seg>
<seg id="8">The voicea sent to important transmission time, because the future is to gather as much support as possible.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that no one else seems to, is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is clearly nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I do not understand why there is a regressive tax to fund programs that could be financed without state aid.</seg>
<seg id="11">The voice is the one second and EastEnders, admittedly within the house.</seg>
<seg id="12">Frankly, other channels would do anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="13">I do not understand what it is all about public service broadcasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">I do not believe that there would be no BBC at all. "</seg>

<seg id="3">"he will now be taken more seriously than it has been for a long time," hakanen writes in his preface.</seg>
<seg id="4">Marx's analysis of capitalist development, economic globalization and the invasion of the ever more widely to all areas of life, the accumulation of capital and financial capital and tried to keep the capital growing role have proved remarkably far-sighted.</seg>

<seg id="7">Surely the former Business Research Institute and the business delegation, the managing director, however, is a Marxist?</seg>
<seg id="8">Certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="9">Korkman says on the phone that he did not regard Marx as a timely economic philosophers but rather interesting social theorists.</seg>
<seg id="10">Now social sciences are diversified, and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitators and literary expert.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the commonly held view is that the intellectual history of the dead man's inaccurate opinions," korkman begin.</seg>
<seg id="12">The fact of the matter is that Marx's predictions went drastically wrong.</seg>
<seg id="13">Even though Marx understood the nature and importance of the Industrial Revolution, he withdrew from the initial stage of capitalism too far going conclusions korkman, considering.</seg>

<seg id="17">"Marx can perhaps provide inspiration for those who wish to understand the bigger picture, as a result of technical upheaval in a changing world ', analyse korkman.</seg>
<seg id="18">But it is what the government should make a decision tomorrow, not Marx do not help.</seg>
<seg id="19">They believe that capitalism is a hopeless case that should be ending.</seg>
<seg id="20">But Marx was in favour of korkmanin considers investigation.</seg>

<seg id="22">"the Maoists and other Trotskyist sects and hatred of all things capitalism, but it is still more of the other."</seg>
<seg id="23">Today, the debate is more varied, and also Marx can be approached without years of ideological and political legacy.</seg>

<seg id="2">Trade unions on Friday organized a big demonstration in many ways is an interesting and quite exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="3">It has not, for example, can be found on the Finnish political history is very good reference points, says professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä Martti siisiäinen.</seg>
<seg id="4">As such, it is not surprising that the trade union movement to protest.</seg>
<seg id="5">If it does not do so, it would lead to rising to his feet in front of the government's hands, siisiäinen says.</seg>
<seg id="6">A very right wing government has hit the Finnish tradition korporatismin central points - and also to those points which have been of the Finnish welfare state, which are important for development.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government's harsh response to interfere with contract law.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is a lot of features to the fact that the trade union movement is really trying to get down on its knees.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time a positive verdict by the trade union movement has to look in the mirror.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mirror needed, for example, for the precise reason that the trade union movement is by no means of all employees to support Friday's protests.</seg>
<seg id="11">What is new is that a rigid division of the demonstration put the number of the trade union movement, which would like to take part in the demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="12">From across Finland gathered here unemployed people demonstrating outside the Houses of Parliament in November 1993.</seg>

<seg id="25">It is from one end to the other.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the We Need Diverse Sipilä communication channels, and Prime Minister on TV and radio talk is one channel among others.</seg>
<seg id="3">This kind of direct channel will be needed in the future.</seg>
<seg id="4">This will not be the last time that Sipilä told reporters in the Swedish parliament.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sipilä would not even assess how frequent the way the prime minister's television and radio speech will be.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Mr Sipilä may not always ignored in the future in the Yle television.</seg>
<seg id="7">If other stations to channel, so then we shall see.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is used Today Tonight, channel Sipilä said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sipilä, Finland, according to the state of the economy is so serious that it requires television and radio speech to the public.</seg>
<seg id="10">This set of issues to deal with, what we are talking about here, is quite a complicated and requires a long argument.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why we have arrived at this station Sipilä explained.</seg>
<seg id="12">The president sent at 21.05) 21.20, both in tv1:ssä Radio Finland.</seg>
<seg id="13">It can also be considered in the Yle arena.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sipilä take bigger risks</seg>
<seg id="15">Media researcher hopes that Sipilä television president of general government inward-looking.</seg>
<seg id="16">Is it, in an effort to take the public debate a more restrictive definition of the law into their own hands, and to refuse a public discussion about the deliberations? considering the Stockholm University professor spike koivunen.</seg>
<seg id="17">Reminds one of the foreign minister (Timo) Soini, recent comments that she will not follow the media agenda and not allow it to define its borders.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the Democratic debate and publicity sake I hope that these issues are not related.</seg>
<seg id="19">Koivunen understands that commercial media is upset about Sipilä announcement.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would be strange if it fails to react to the media environment.</seg>
<seg id="21">The political powers of communication styles are not the things in a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is up to the representatives of the media to try to make the definition that politicians do not take agenda.</seg>
<seg id="23">Koivunen that television is a big risk for Sipilä.</seg>
<seg id="24">Sipilä ought to bring to the table today in his speech to say something new and special, so to set extraordinarily high expectations have been met.</seg>
<seg id="25">Today there is more on what we have already heard of?</seg>
<seg id="26">Or will he be able to speak in a different tone, a different way or different words, or to say something new?</seg>
<seg id="27">Koivunen says that if there are going to be just more of the same old thing, you might ask, why such a grand gesture was made and YLE gave it in exceptional times.</seg>
<seg id="28">YLE also take this risk in so far as that is the case, if it were not a specific situation but routine, among others.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is a danger that YLE stigma for a politician or a committee jointly set up by the government and media, which surely is not threatening the interests of the public.</seg>
<seg id="30">From the artful Sipilä veto</seg>
<seg id="31">In the future, Mr Sipilä, it is also important to what Prime Minister neglect to say, media researcher points out.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the evening, to be careful about what Sipilä missing and what not, says the University of Jyväskylä study coordinator Heikki kuutti.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the 'old TV president Sipilä is a clever move because, in this way, this can bring their ideas forward without dissenting voices.</seg>
<seg id="34">This will get the message to the public at large without journalistic filters, in contrast to the briefing, where journalists are able to ask critical questions.</seg>
<seg id="35">Sipilä bypass the media and speak directly to the people.</seg>
<seg id="36">There is, however, a risk that the media will interpret the speech wrong, as further questions will not be present.</seg>
<seg id="37">According to the 'old, it is very important how Sipilä appears in TV - running sweat, trembling hands.</seg>
<seg id="38">He compared the Sipilä father figure who now tells people what to do.</seg>
<seg id="39">If Sipilä knows how to present his case well, it can work.</seg>
<seg id="40">The situation is different than it was then, if our government information about something, because these people were speaking directly to another person.</seg>
<seg id="41">This kind of (US President Barack) Obama and I are partners on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="42">Truly exceptional</seg>
<seg id="43">Political scientist erkka crevasse attaches to the prime minister's speech to the public truly exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="44">He says that has not happened in decades, and that the prime minister is speaking directly to the people.</seg>
<seg id="45">Exceptional times call for exceptional measures, crevasse says.</seg>
<seg id="46">The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to get to the front of the Finns to receptive is blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="47">Employee organizations are holding a Friday demonstration and strikes against the measures taken by the government.</seg>
<seg id="48">Left-wing union chairman Paavo Arhinmäki said in Twitter that Sipilä, can make his speech to the nation on the state of play in the Swedish parliament as prime minister, when the announcement of the speech will also be discussed.</seg>

<seg id="35">How much has to be able to influence the player procurement, Pekka rautakallio?</seg>
<seg id="36">The last season of the implications for procurement and, unfortunately, the situation in the market, it was time to narrow rautakallio replied diplomatically.</seg>

<seg id="3">In the Russian media in recent days has spread a lot of assertions, which, according to the Ministry of Emergency Situations had to mobilize a large tank hatch zotovia for over five hours.</seg>
<seg id="4">Zotov has since done everything it can to deny these reports.</seg>
<seg id="5">He even published its own public Facebook page a picture in which she appears to be difficult for armoured vehicles at her door in a very good mood, at least in the pictures to be about any halt or get angry.</seg>
<seg id="6">Utter nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="7">From the start, that I did not go into the main battle tank, but it was the infantry fighting vehicle BMP 3.</seg>
<seg id="8">I am a former soldier, Lieutenant Colonel, served in the Urals.</seg>
<seg id="9">I went there, I had a good look around and I came in peace out, Zotov told komosomolskaja Pravda.</seg>
<seg id="10">Rather than get bogged down in not really spent five hours in that position, he said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Russian army TV channel Zotov explained his exhibition in Russia, which stands elegantly on the banks of the new technologies, because she herself is a former professional soldier.</seg>

<seg id="21">Zotovin words in support of the fact that no photographs of the alleged halt have not been published, although the arms exhibition held in the space of a few days, a total of 50, 000 people.</seg>
<seg id="22">The argument took off originally from zotovin halt .ru website Bloknot affair, which told of zotovin rimpuilleen tank hatch their escape attempt and has threatened to shoot at the end of everything, if he does not get out of the bind.</seg>
<seg id="23">Later Bloknot website published a follow-up story, in which the organizers of the exhibition, explained its point of view what has happened.</seg>
<seg id="24">All have just got used to the fact that the soldiers quickly jump out of armoured vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Zotov, a member of parliament because of his large size, which has been replete, simply, when they come out.</seg>

<seg id="1">The United States is trying to tighten monetary policy following Fed</seg>
<seg id="2">The United States next recession begins its highest levels less than a year, but three years after the country's central bank take the Fed raising interest rates again in a long time.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the financial markets and the rot begins to turn before the next recession.</seg>
<seg id="4">It has been suggested the US Federal Reserve to begin raising interest rates, possibly as early as this week and at the latest by the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">So the next recession will be able to pin its highest levels over the next autumn by the financial markets and the exchange rate of the Eurasian reed before then.</seg>
<seg id="6">Or at least that is what would happen if the world's largest economy and the financial markets work in the way that they have been in the habit - and if they were to respond to blackmail, after the Federal Reserve off funds, as they have done before.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of such conclusions are arrived at German banks, Deutsche Bank London market research strategy, Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker is in large long-term economic cycles and market research.</seg>
<seg id="8">The bank distribute more than 60 pages long term asset return study research report available to its big international customers last week.</seg>
<seg id="9">Studies and reports staged to make us believe that they do not know exactly when the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates or what the economy and the market will happen after that.</seg>
<seg id="10">Instead, he has the cooler statistics, economic facts and calculations to show us how the economy and the markets have behaved in the past, after the Federal Reserve raising interest rates during and after.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to the historical observations, they look at what the economy and financial markets are now a key variable for the same or a different model than previous interest rates rise - and what the possible consequences.</seg>
<seg id="12">Apparent that both the economy and the financial markets are now in shaky condition to withstand higher interest rates than it has been since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the beginning of the recession may not years</seg>
<seg id="14">The American Federal Reserve monetary policy and its current leaders are tuning to last throughout the summer and early autumn, tried to insinuate that the time is ripe to start raising interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="15">The first interest rate hike by more than nine years in may come as early as this week.</seg>
<seg id="16">The issue will be resolved during the course of Wednesday and Thursday, when, after the Federal Reserve Board, the so-called avomarkkinakomitea meets to take a decision on this by their kaksipäiväiseen meeting.</seg>
<seg id="17">The last time the US Federal Reserve raised its so-called fed to offset interest rates in June 2006.</seg>
<seg id="18">It ended exactly two years of relatively small but regular interest on a 0.25 percentage point interest rate hike by the series, in which the Fed raised its interest rate from 1.25% to 25%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Financial markets oireilu began in 2007 with the United States risky mortgage financing difficulties and, a year later, the financial crisis has burst like a global doomsday nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="20">Come with a major recession in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="21">The last time the financial markets and the real economy serious setbacks began more slowly than in the past, after the Federal Reserve raising interest rates since it is typically the case in the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">Similarly, the ordeal was not severe and harsh than at any time since the 1930s depression.</seg>
<seg id="23">Deutschen strategists have been screened with the largest economies in the world, as well as the ups and downs of the financial market developments in this area from 1950 onwards and in some places is always the beginning of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="24">The increases in interest rates by the American Federal Reserve and the economic and fiscal impact they have accounted for since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="25">The slump is the first rise in interest rates after its highest period of less than a year, usually in less than three years, and an average of less than three and a half years.</seg>
<seg id="26">Financial markets have been closed for two years of rate increases in the foreseeable future, after the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="27">The US Federal Reserve is by taking and reduced its interest rates since the beginning of the 1950s, about a dozen different cycle of massive amount of money.</seg>
<seg id="28">Each time is different in some respects from the other, and the Times is in the review is a relatively tight, so they can hardly conclude with any certainty about the effects of raising interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="29">Even strategists point out that, this time, a lot of it is a different matter.</seg>
<seg id="30">Not just better.</seg>
<seg id="31">Interest rates too low for too long</seg>
<seg id="32">Decisive factors in the financial crisis, let alone guilty, not necessarily establish beyond doubt, even in the decades of research work.</seg>
<seg id="33">But there are three things about the crisis that led to its destruction and increased the power of reason is more or less unquestionably aware:</seg>
<seg id="34">1) fed the euro zone, the ECB and other major central banks in the world in the 21st century, its interest rates too low for too long.</seg>
<seg id="35">They patch up a bubble, at the same time and was brought up by the next one.</seg>
<seg id="36">2) the financial economy and the real economy in the various parts of the accumulated over decades and which was already too large a debt increased from central banks loose money policy impact to become even more male-dominated.</seg>
<seg id="37">There stands the biggest debt bubble in the history of its economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">3) especially in the financial economy almost without disincentives were packed into the crazy cheap debt financing of the inflated to most areas of the financial markets in the biggest bubble in the history of the stands in exchange for shares, property, bonds and commodities.</seg>
<seg id="39">There was hardly a very stringent controversy in that increasingly complex leverage on soaring financial markets is exceptionally dangerous and unstable way, when the US Federal Reserve and other central banks have pushed interest rates up last time.</seg>
<seg id="40">Leverage on financial facilities let alone a valuation bubble pimp did not endure as his time after efforts were initiated by interest-rate increases and the cost of debt financing has gone up.</seg>
<seg id="41">The risks were achieved during the financial crisis, and that was followed by a major recession.</seg>
<seg id="42">A bigger bubble and more debt</seg>
<seg id="43">Deutschen strategists do not guess at what happens next, but, for example, by mentioning a subject tuumailun facts such as the following:</seg>
<seg id="44">1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept its monetary policy stance still light on even longer than it was before the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="45">If interest rates were too low for too long before the crisis, they are now even longer is even lower.</seg>
<seg id="46">2) debt is crazy cheap for a long time been like ten years ago, but now its quite literally cheap debt money is cheaper than free.</seg>
<seg id="47">Therefore, the financial economy and the real economy debt load does not recede but now mired in various parts of the economy to generate a heavier debt load than before the financial crisis, or, for that matter, at any time in the past.</seg>
<seg id="48">3) The former and the torrent of cheap central bank liquidity has gone into circulation is largely left to the financial markets and pushes the main securities and property type for their most expensive since before the financial crisis peak or indeed ever.</seg>
<seg id="49">Strategy not only on the mood in the financial markets in the Latin warning signs, but he also points out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and recession in decades of heavy to the model than has been the case in the past.</seg>
<seg id="50">The eurozone economy is unlikely to recover at all.</seg>
<seg id="51">In other words, the real economy is unusually weak but that on balance, the financial pressures and risks are incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, when the Fed will begin to tighten its monetary screws.</seg>
<seg id="52">Maybe the French bank Societe generalen strategy Albert Edwards the future picture is not as bizarre as the swathe, could make a difference.</seg>
<seg id="53">He has already made a good preparation time for international investors to bank customers, after the Federal Reserve The Next U-turn:</seg>
<seg id="54">First, the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates, then the fiscal bubble burst - and soon, after the Federal Reserve and the time has come to put out the financial fires with even more QE raharuiskuilla.</seg>

<seg id="4">Western countries have not yet taken up the proposal in the belief that Assad's fall in the space of a few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="5">Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012, five permanent members of the Security Council with the country.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ahtisaari, according to the Russian ambassador, Vitaly tshurkin listed for him in a face-to-face discussion of the three point plan to: opposition not arming the opposition and al-Assad should immediately get the connection between the president and the Al Assad relinquish power there had to be discreet.</seg>

<seg id="8">We do not necessarily agree on all of them, but we will be able to keep the lines of communication open.</seg>
<seg id="9">I told him what I was doing there, and he said that Martin, sit down, so I will tell you what we ought to do, Mr Ahtisaari, harking back to the Guardian in an interview.</seg>
<seg id="10">Diplomats do not comment</seg>
<seg id="11">Ahtisaari, who says that he convey tshurkinin signal to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.</seg>
<seg id="12">Tshurkin confirmed to the press, not the content of the discussions, but according to Ahtisaari, it is not two words.</seg>
<seg id="13">The diplomats from the United Nations, Ahtisaari refused to comment on the allegations but said that Assad's forces were already at that date made a series of massacres and key opposition groups refused every single one of these agreements, which he would have remained in power.</seg>
<seg id="14">The British Foreign Office Middle East department of the former leader, Sir John Jenkins sees Ahtisaari, reluctantly, because of his experience in Russia was never prepared to discuss Assad's fate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Officially, Russia has supported Al al-Assad throughout the war period.</seg>
<seg id="16">The weakest point in the argument is that Ahtisaari tshurkin spoke in Moscow under a mandate.</seg>
<seg id="17">If he had to tell me about tshurkinin speeches, I would have answered that I want to hear from Russian President Vladimir Putin in order to be taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jenkins said that he will continue to be so in the case of suspected that it had been a stunt to keep Putin in power, some Assad's supporters.</seg>

<seg id="1">The US central bank policy-makers will sit for two days this week in a huge mahogany table the long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="2">At the other end of the central bank, decorative double-decker Hall, is a mural in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The map is a reminder of the fact that the president of the European Central Bank, Janet L. yellenin and his colleagues must be set for the nations' economic interests take precedence over everything else.</seg>
<seg id="4">Congress has fallen to the central bank to shoulder the dual responsibility of the United States should maximize employment and keep prices stable.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Great Depression after central bank leaders, however, we must accept that there is a third, an unwritten mandate: economic stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is this third requirement could be a determining factor in the decision, announced Thursday, which is so tight that it cannot even predict that the decision on whether it is ready to wean the US economy from the unprecedented incentives, which at the end of the 2008 stood at almost zero short-term interest rates has brought.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even though most of the data shows the economy growing strongly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may have already done in advance to guard against the central bank officials are more frightened of the volatility of increasing fear, how would the federal, here the reference value, which would raise to offset at least a quarter of a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"understandably, the labour market and inflation is the first and most important issues, which will be monitored," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Stifel Nicolas & brokerage business co:n chief economic expert.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I believe, however, that if they seek to justify leaving interest rates unchanged, increasing uncertainty in the world market has enough valid argument is still waiting," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The central bank decision has not reached consensus, and it gives rise to an already nervous about the economy.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bloombergin, in a recent survey, about half of economic experts predict that an interest rate rise this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">While financial markets expect the central bank to delay an increase, according to key indicators as an opportunity for growth is only around 30%.</seg>
<seg id="13">This suggests the stock market drop if the central bank will raise the top level, if we do not then manage to soften the blow by promising that the next increase will not happen in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228 points, 89, 1 and 4%, new figures to be 16 599, 85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The recovery brought to the expectations that the central bank keeps rate unchanged this week, says John Lonski, Moody's capital markets research group -rymän main economic expert.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it would be surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If policy makers to raise interest rates, "they have to see a lot of trouble in its position to support the financial markets so that they were not in a state of panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Some experts claim that higher level of reassurance to the financial markets, because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the central bank will act.</seg>
<seg id="19">Just a month ago, it seemed that, as a result, the central bank this month to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, so the first small steps towards monetary tightening up the slow economic recovery in the United States, certifying the stability.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen has said that in the spring and early summer that he expected the level is set to rise this year, despite the fact that the Liberals are calling in their complaints further economic development.</seg>
<seg id="21">While job creation slowed in the month of August, the labour market growth has been steady this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate fell last month to 5.1%, which is the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level the central bank considers the full limit.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage growth has shown signs of renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even though inflation is still below the central bank's 2% annual target, the central bank policymakers that the main reason for this is the significantly lower oil prices is a temporary effect.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the economy should emerge from the larger move interest rates and also needs them given the tight situation on the labour market," says Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economic expert.</seg>
<seg id="26">Financial markets around the world, however, upset last week when China devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16 per cent of its record in May, when investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy will also slow down global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10 per cent below May's record high.</seg>
<seg id="29">The central bank policymakers market turmoil has an additional element in the complex equation that says because interest rates will be raised.</seg>
<seg id="30">"without those financial market events and last week's news on China's economic weakness, policy makers tighten level at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate Research Specialist Centre and a former central bank official.</seg>
<seg id="31">He now predicts that the makers are expecting at least a month to get a better idea of the impact.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the possible consequences for the American economy is still rather unclear, and they do not have much information at their disposal when it comes to the consequences of what is happening in China," Oliner said.</seg>
<seg id="33">The international economic welfare is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not influence the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="34">In practice, the federal Central Bank, but it has become the world's monetary authority.</seg>
<seg id="35">In recent years, the central bank's influence is enormous.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 2013, the then chairman, Ben räddar bernanken, suggesting that the central bank can increase the number of "narrow" money, moved on to cause turbulence in markets around the world.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world where the market and economy are increasingly are intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only in the next Progress elsewhere, we also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science," says Zachary Karabell, a property management company, Envestnet inc:in global strategy chief.</seg>
<seg id="39">The state of Virginia in Richmond, located in the federal database (deputy) of the Federal Reserve bank president Jeffrey Lacker pointed out this month that "the central bank has, in the past, overreact to financial market movements that have affected disconnected from economic fundamentals."</seg>
<seg id="40">The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee has called for an increase in interest rates, and Lacker, a voting member of the committee, gave the example of 1998, 99 decisions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Asian financial crisis, the central bank has cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points in the three meetings during the "in spite of its limited, who are recognisable effects of US economic growth," Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later the central bank reversed these cuts.</seg>
<seg id="43">The central bank should put economic stability to the fore just as a time of major crisis, such as when the market collapsed in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, Bank of England (Bank of England) rate for determining the former committee member.</seg>
<seg id="44">The latest turmoil does not come anywhere near its level, Posen said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"no one wants to create a situation in which the base rate because of a fear that the market 'annoyance, the Peterson Institute for International Economics Institute chairman Posen says.</seg>
<seg id="46">Federal law on the central bank (the Federal Reserve Act should continue to include such double standards, not to mention the economic stability, and as long as that is the case, they do not think it is going to be predictable.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the event of any legal intervention does not happen, then later in the day, I believe this man to be executed.</seg>
<seg id="3">If that happens, and I hope not, I sit in the visitors' gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary prison to see Richard Glossip execution by lethal injection.</seg>

<seg id="11">Oklahoma has reduced the media reserved seats from 12 to five.</seg>

<seg id="25">He did not tell me what I should be writing, not to do so even though, he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">I have said to him that he can at any time remove me from their witness list.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he wants to see here is the international journalist who writes on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="28">If Glossip die, he believes that the publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Huffington Post's passenger Kim Bellware Is By My Side.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you want to know more about the case, can listen to my podcast series broadcasts.</seg>

<seg id="32">I am not able to say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="33">His actions after the murder of Barry Van treesen make them in any case where the blame lies for the relief effort.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I think that is a very strong possibility that he is not guilty of murder.</seg>
<seg id="35">I believe that the death penalty does not justify the evidence was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="36">I believe that his execution is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="37">And so this is the perspective from which I think he died.</seg>
<seg id="38">I cannot claim to be totally impartial.</seg>

<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made itself barely conceal their reference to stormiin after it defeated the North Queensland on Saturday night in the finale of a shortlist compiled cowboysit.

<seg id="5">Bellamy defended his team and body checks, saying that they only focus on the 'contacts' taklatessa.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added that their confidence added two of the leading coach of criticism towards stormia, because it means that they are afraid of losing out to the team.</seg>
<seg id="7">"this always comes up - I did not talk about the River Trent Robinson's wrestling, when we lost to them 2 to 24," Bellamy said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee you that we have not changed anything in our defence system or our technology throughout the year. In the last six weeks have only underlined the contact body checks, and it has led us to be a success.</seg>
<seg id="9">River Trent has been in the team for three years, and he is obviously a great team they train, so he is probably not used to disappear, and so that was a shock for him.</seg>
<seg id="10">Funny how this always comes up at this time of year.</seg>

<seg id="13">He regarded as important to compare its Saturday night game to our game on Friday night and tell you how exciting it was, "Bellamy said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember how the 2010 St George are frequently criticised for being a boring team and Wayne said that he could not care less.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team capable of playing the kind of rugbya, which we consider to be exciting, especially when he has the quick young guys.</seg>
<seg id="16">I want to play games like that, when you have that type of players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He set it up the side of 2010, now he wants all of his playing style - not in any team rugbya is guys like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt in order to play.</seg>
<seg id="18">Then I will be more confident when they say these kinds of things, because they are a little bit worried about playing against us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago, they probably did not think of us as opposed to the important games.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also pointed out that the international game and Stormin roostersien points are richer than broncosin cowboysien and between play.</seg>
<seg id="21">Broncos game was definitely a good game to play, and I have not seen it yet, but how will it end? 12? 16</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game was 20 to 18, so we had two goals, but is it more exciting rugbya?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or to make it more exciting line of defence and breaking the goal and failing to do so?</seg>
<seg id="24">This, for me, is about to join.</seg>
<seg id="25">If they are not saying a word about us, it means that at some point we will be able to play against them.</seg>
<seg id="26">The stormilla this weekend is free, because they already have won the right to a home game to either north Queensland or Cronulla cowboyseja sharkseja against next Saturday night's semi-final, in the examples quoted. Park ticket will be on sale next Tuesday morning.</seg>

<seg id="7">The same with those who were not depressed, and possible mental health problems, and the probability of the emergence of halved again, if they were of sound mind friend.</seg>
<seg id="8">But friendship can do so, it must be a first.</seg>
<seg id="9">This enables us to communicate via social media, in a style that goes beyond the immediacy of the content and the response is often more important than meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital lives, have doubled the need appears to be strong, happy and successful, whereas the reality is that the remote control.</seg>
<seg id="11">These superficial values which are dominated by the success of the so-called external psychologists: money, social status, image and all this is happening for internal values - the desire for personal growth and friendship - at the expense of those who have a more profound effect on our mental health.</seg>
<seg id="12">And video game developers such as billionaire recently explained that the money must not, in fact, greater happiness.</seg>

<seg id="15">Joeyn Chandler with a hug, and many moments in a comfortable chair watching football, Miss Ross rachelia - this comedy came from the knowledge that, yes, men can identify with it all, even though they are often hesitant to fully explore their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Samaritans volunteer organization, explained to me: "people who are depressed ...kuunnellessani and self-destructive, I really realised how the slightest interaction with a friend may improve the conditions."</seg>
<seg id="17">Often the men who contacted me, I do not feel able to talk to your friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old "more than them getting on 'is strong, as is the feeling that if it opens up the problem, will be seen as weak.</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to provide long-term means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="20">It highlights the friendship between the two men in just a moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even if an impartial, outside my status at the other end of the phone to help people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from close, personal family and network of friends.</seg>

<seg id="17">On the other hand, PSG has had to lurch between for missed feed-in and poor finishing especially ibrahimovicilta which failed due to a total of only five in the first half-time and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in the contact between the ibrahimovicin right at the start of the second half.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, he was far more effective in making its case for the work of his colleagues, and that is exactly the senses ibrahimovicin Di Maria deployed a spiral kick which went wilandin goalposts around in the 52nd minute.</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal came at the end of the game an hour after his sixth goal of the season that hit uruguaylaisen Cavan thanks after Ibrahimovic knuckles forward from Maxwell's cross ball from the left.</seg>
<seg id="20">It ran out of Malmö in the hopes of getting back into the game, and only a brilliant fight against David wilandin luizin direct kick to final numbers low before the exchange become Ezequiel lavezzin paint was dismissed by the very end of the game.</seg>
<seg id="21">Malmö coach Age Hareide admitted later that PSG is one level higher than his team of Norwegians, said: 'our viimeisein play Arsenal in the Champions League was in December of last year. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.</seg>
