An amazing gesture from an NHL star - “The all-time biggest donation made by an athlete”
The Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6,7 million euros) to Montreal Children’s Hospital.
According to the hospital’s announcement, this is the all-time biggest single charity donation made by an athlete in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban has pledged to help the hospital in other fundraising for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban made an 8-year contract worth 72 million dollars with the Canadiens.
That means Subban's donation is significantly larger than his 9-million dollar annual earnings.
As a recognition for his donation, an atrium in the hospital will be named after Subban.
Canadiens players have already before significantly helped the local hospitals.
The long-time captain, Jean Beliveau, who passed away a year ago raised millions of dollars for, for instance, the same children’s hospital, and Saku Koivu raised a hefty sum to another big hospital in the city, which was used to buy a PET scanner needed in cancer examinations.
