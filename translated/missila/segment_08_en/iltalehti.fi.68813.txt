Lukko is about to meet a true playoff monster: “Goals will be tight”
Tappara and Lukko continue their hard work in Hakametsä today, when both teams are under fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicts that there will be no real scoring party in Hakametsä today.
Tappara visited Kuopio yesterday and drilled a 3-2 extra time win over KalPa.
That was a manly climb, since the last season’s silver team was lagging two goals behind at the worst.
For Lukko, Tuesday was played in more of a minor key.
The Rauma team caught zero points from a visit to Blues who had a sluggish start, with the numbers of the defeat also being 2-3.
Hard game, tough to score, if they play the same type of game than last year, predicted Lukko forward Janne Lahti on the team's website.
Tappara has become quite a playoff nightmare to the team from Rauma.
During the two previous seasons it has been exactly Tappara who has won Lukko and progressed to the finals.
Both time this has required a determining seventh game.
Last season Lukko had three wins before the fourth game, but in the next three, Tappara first came square with Lukko and then went past it.
There are no big changes in the line-ups of the teams, except goalkeepers.
Both teams’ goalies were on duty yesterday and can rest today.
Mika Noronen from Tappara’s goal makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and Rasmus Rinne will replace Ryan Zapolski between Lukko’s goalposts.
