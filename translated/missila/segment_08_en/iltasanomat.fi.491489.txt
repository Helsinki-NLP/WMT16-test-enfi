Britannia making a fuss over a Labour leader declining to sing the national anthem
The song lyrics ask God to protect the Queen, but Corbyn opposes the monarchy.
The criticism by the press, leaning towards right, has been agreed with MPs also from Corbynâ€™s own Labour party.
This has offended the people, suspected Labour MP Kate Green in a radio interview by BBC.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined in in the singing.
The memorial service yesterday was held to honour the RAF pilotsâ€™ fight against German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In its official statement, Labour party defends Corbyn and emphasises that he did show respect for the pilots by attending the event.
The heroism of the Royal Air Force is something to which we all owe an enormous debt of gratitude.
He (Corbyn) stood in respectful silence during the anthem, the statement emphasised.
Corbynâ€™s election to party leadership has divided Labour party.
Especially among the MPs there are those, who fear that his radical views will scare the more moderate voters.
Corbyn supports unilateral disarmament and opposes cuts to public services and welfare.
Today is the first time Corbyn is supposed to act as a party leader in the parliament during Prime Minister's Questions.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what he should ask from Prime Minister David Cameron.
During the weekend, Cameron criticised Corbynâ€™s election as party leader on Twitter.
The Labour Party is now a threat to our national security, our economic security and your family's security, tweeted the Prime Minister from his own account.
