This is why you cannot get rid of useless iPhone applications
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least part of the applications that come with Apple iPhones can possibly be removed sometime in the future - but not all of them.
Apple is possibly going to remove some of their own applications from iPhones in the future, says the company CEO, Tim Cook, in an interview for Buzzfeed.
There is a bunch of applications in Apple iPhone that relatively few have use of: For example FaceTime calls, Newsstand, Health, Stocks, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these applications is Apple Watch, which was an obligatory update to iPhones, even though it is necessary only those who own Apple Watch.
According to Cook, removing Apple applications is a more complex issue than it first appears.
There are some apps that are linked to something else on the iPhone.
If they were to be removed they might cause issues elsewhere on the phone, Cook states to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple iPhone applications function closely with other applications.
There are other apps that arenâ€™t like that.
So over time, I think we can figure out a way to let the user remove them, said Cook.
So according to Cook, Apple is looking into the matter, because the company does not want to waste memory space from the usersâ€™ iPhones.
