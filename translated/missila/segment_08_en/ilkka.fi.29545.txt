 La ConfrĂ©rie de la ChaĂ®ne des RĂ´tisseurs Finlande, PaistinkĂ¤Ă¤ntĂ¤jĂ¤t, celebrates World ChaĂ®ne Day also in Ostrobothnia
On the World ChaĂ®ne Day, 25th September, there are events in different restaurants and shops that have been granted the professional RĂ´tisseurs Finlande plaque.
The goal of the day is to promote the high-level gastronomical skills in Finland and to make it easier to go to a restaurant, as well as to increase the information about the significance of the plaque as part of high quality.
At the same time, the objective is to remind people that not all quality restaurants are centred in the metropolitan area, but there are top restaurants inspected and classified by an independent operator across Finland.
The international attention received by the event is a sign about its significance as part of making the plaque restaurants and the organisation better known.
In Ostrobothnia, the event is organised in Vaasa, in restaurants Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, Vanhankaupungin ravintola takes part in the event.
The event has been noticed internationally, as well.
It has been decided that the event will be one of the most important international events of the organisation, and that it will be organised around the world on the same day.
Finland will still be the host country of the world.
