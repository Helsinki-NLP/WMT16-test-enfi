Popular brand Kia introduced two new products at the Frankfurt International Motor Show - these are new Sportage and Optima
From a Finnish point of view, the more important of these two novelties is the fourth-generation Sportage Kia is planning to use to seize a bigger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
The Sportage, created under the direction of the new European Chief Designer Gregory Guillaume, is more rounded in form than earlier.
There is an extra centimetre here and there as to the wheelbase and outside measures, and the car slices the air even more efficiently than before.
In outline, the engine selection is the same, but a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepowers has been added to the roster.
More information about Kia Sportage, its performance and fuel consumption will be revealed closer to its launch.
We have to wait for it a bit, for the new Sportage arrives in spring 2016.
Already before the year changes, the new Kia Optima arrives in our country.
At a first glance it does not look to have changed, but it is a completely new car.
Kia intends to win over the hearts of the upper middleclass buyers with even better road-handling characteristics, lower noise level and higher-grade equipment.
At first we will have Optimas with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and a 2.0-litre gas engines.
Next summer the pace will accelerate, as a new Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbocharged engine will join them.
Around the same time with its arrival, the sales for Optima estate car will begin.
