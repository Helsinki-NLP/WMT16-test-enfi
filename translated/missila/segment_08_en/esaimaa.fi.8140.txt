Hard savings ahead for Lappeenranta University: The goal is to save 8.5 million, the staff will be reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology will begin to implement savings measures, with a goal to cut costs for a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the university begins employee cooperation negotiations that concern the whole staff, with an annual savings goal of 6.5 million.
In practice, this means that there is a need to cut about 130 employees.
In addition, the goal is to save 2 million from other activities.
The background to the cooperation negotiations is the budget for 2016, which forecast a deficit of about 8.5 million to the actual operations.
The governmentâ€™s cuts also have an effect.
During this financial year, the university will make a deficit of about 2.6 million.
For next year, the costs will go slightly up, but at the same time the financing from the ministry will be cut by 2 million and other financing by 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is about 85 million euros, so that means the savings goal is ten per cent of the total budget.
The massive cuts targeted at teaching and research as well as the reduction of corporate financing have a significant joint effect on our university, states rector Anneli Pauli in the university press release.
Before the summer the effects of the cuts seemed more moderated, but now the reduction of additional financing is shown in new proportions.
The discussions with the employeeâ€™s representatives will begin on Tuesday next week and they will last six weeks as provided in the law.
