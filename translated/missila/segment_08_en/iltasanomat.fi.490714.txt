10 points about the effects of the Friday stop on you - see the video!
The trade unionsâ€™ organise a demonstration at Helsinki Railway Station on Friday between 11 A.M. and 1 P.M., but the strike will have an effect on the citizensâ€™ lives for considerably longer - the whole day or even longer.
ISTV found out with 10 points how this Friday stop will affect the citizens.
From the video you can see what impacts the strike will have on land and railway services - the transport of both goods and passengers.
Air transport is another matter.
The strike actions cause severe disturbance at least around midday, but will probably continue to affect the air transport until Saturday.
What about schools and nurseries?
Police, fire brigade?
Grocery shops, Alko off-licence shops, postal services - not to mention factories and harbours?
The details of the strike information can change before Friday.
Ilta-Sanomat website will keep you updated.
