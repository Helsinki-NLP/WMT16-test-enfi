TohmajĂ¤rvi council approved sap hall warehouse expansion
TohmajĂ¤rvi council unanimously, but slightly grudgingly, approved the Nordic Koivu Ltd. hall, also known as the sap hall, warehouse expansion.
The fact that the project is larger and more expensive than originally planned caused criticism.
The busy schedule also irritated.
The council slightly wondered how this need for space was not known a year ago, when the previous expansion was approved.
At this stage, the warehouse expansion of 400-450 square metres was accepted as part of the investment programme, but the financial side will be approved later in the interim report.
The agenda still mentioned an investment of 150,000 to 200,000 euros, but in the meeting the technical manager Erkki Ikonen stated that the cost will be about 300,000 euros.
The investment was supported on the ground that it brings work and tax revenue to the area.
The municipality has no risk, because the company will pay for the investment as rent, reasoned Vesa VĂ¤istĂ¶ (Finns party).
