Computer and printer manufacturer Hewlett-Packard (HP) plans to shed up to 33,000 jobs.
The main part of the cuts will be targeted to the enterprise services business, says the company.
In November, HP is splitting into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, focussing on the enterprise business, and HP Inc., focussing on computers and printers for consumers.
HP had the most personnel in 2011, when it had 350,000 employees.
In November last year the number had been reduced to 302,000.
The company will enter a charge of 2.7 billion dollars (about 2.4 billion euros) for the restructuring.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will cut 25,000-30,000 jobs.
The consumer side cuts will be 3,300 during three years.
HP intends to relocate its operations to lower-cost countries so that 60 percent of its employees will work in low-cost countries by 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business operations in a way that none of its clients is responsible for over ten percent of the companyâ€™s business result.
As recently as the year before last, its three most significant clients created 65 percent of the business result.
