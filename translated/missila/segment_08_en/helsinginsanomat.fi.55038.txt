American Olympic runner tells about her illness and becoming a prostitute in her book
Three-time Olympian 1500 metre runner Suzy Favor Hamiltonâ€™s new book has attracted attention in the United States.
In her book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton tells about how she quit her career and ended up as an escort.
Sports Illustrated published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended her career in Sydney Olympics.
She took part in the competition in top shape and ran the second fastest time in the qualifications.
In the finals she panicked, though.
Right in the beginning she ran to the lead and defended her position running like a maniac.
150 metres before the goal her strength ran out, however.
She fell to the track and other runners passed her one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I will never run again.
I forced myself to cross the goal line, says Favor Hamilton in her book.
Later it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
Her brother Dan had committed a suicide a year before Sydney Olympics, and she was under terrible pressure to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was 43 years old when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was intrigued by the idea of receiving money from having sex with strange men.
She also persuaded her husband to approve her actions.
Favor Hamiltonâ€™s rate was 450 euros per hour.
She says she used the money in luxury life.
One Favor Hamiltonâ€™s explanation for becoming a prostitute was the fact she missed the same adrenaline spikes she had while competing.
Later Favor Hamilton found out that she had bipolar disorder.
The former star athleteâ€™s double life was exposed in the end of 2012, when Smoking Gun published an article about her.
Favor Hamilton participated in three Olympiads: Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000 she was number on in the statistics for 1500 metres, her time being 3.57,40, but she was the last in Sydney Olympic finals.
