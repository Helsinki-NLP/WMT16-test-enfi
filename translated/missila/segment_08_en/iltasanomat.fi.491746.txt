The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) will also encourage technological progression and innovation, the announcement by Intel said.
The board will encompass top security industry talent across the globe.
The ASRB researchers will perform ongoing security tests and audits intended to codify best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.

We can, and must, raise the bar against cyberattacks in automobiles, said Chris Young, general manager of Intel Security.
With the help of the ASRB, Intel can establish security best practices and encourage the view that cybersecurity is an essential ingredient in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our safety while on the road, making the ASRB the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the worldâ€™s leading computer science innovators.
