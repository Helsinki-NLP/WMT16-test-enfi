Traffic jams most likely worse than expected: Metro and trams could stop for the whole Friday
Metro and tram drivers decide today whether they widen their actions relating to Fridayâ€™s protest.
The original plan was to halt metro and train traffic only during the protest to be organised on Friday.
Whether the traffic will stop for the whole day will be decided during the afternoon.
Chief Shop Steward Pekka Hirvonen says the bluster in the field is great.
The cuts in night and shift pay sting the drivers badly, so the Governmentâ€™s plans about pay cuts cause opposition.
Hirvonen thinks that halting the traffic for the whole day is a kind of a dilemma.
If metro and trams stop for Friday, public transport in the metropolitan area is practically all but halted.
According to VR information, there are no train service on Friday between 6 oâ€™clock in the morning and 6 in the evening.
There will be no short-haul or long-distance traffic on Friday.
The trains that leave before six in the morning will be driven to their destination.
According to HSL, most of the buses will stay at the depot.
The members of AKT will be absent from work from Friday morning 3 oâ€™clock until Saturday morning 3 oâ€™clock.
Most likely a small number of bus lines can be driven with managerial staff, estimates HSL spokesperson Pirkko Repo.
Repo says HSL cannot yet say for certain which buses will be operating on Friday.
The employee organisations ore organising a big demonstration on Helsinki Railway Square on Friday between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.
