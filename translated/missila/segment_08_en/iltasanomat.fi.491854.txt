Hard laws of modelling world: No home, youâ€™re lonely, competition is terrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to correct the impression that modelling world is pure glamour and champagne parties.
She made her own documentary called Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and her colleagues say their piece about modelling business.
Harpeerâ€™s Bazaar put together Leloupâ€™s six hard truths from behind the scenes.
Every season is a new start.
Even if you had posed in top designersâ€™ outfits during the previous season, the new season always starts with castings.
And each season new girls arrive, and the veterans must compete against the fresh faces.
Models rarely have a place of their own to call home.
The work is constant travelling, and it can mean even an entire year of living out of hotels and apartments, where the fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, he loneliness can be very challenging.
New York and Paris can be sought after places to work in, but they are the most stressful.
There are different standards of thin.
An agent in New York may tell you to lose a few kilos, but in Paris they then may think you look too skinny.
Getting a job is constant risky game.
During the fashion week, models and designers are together the whole time and, at the same time, serve as a support system.
When the fashion weeks are over, separation is sad.
Models choose this job for the opportunities it affords them, but it rankles them that everybody thinks the work is just presenting clothes.
Even models want to be personalities.
The job makes them feel like they are actors in a role.
Modelling is also a form of self-expression.
