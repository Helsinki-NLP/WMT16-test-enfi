Dork or cool?
Big logos make a return to shirts
Lately trendsettersâ€™ shirt fronts have been decorated by big logos.
A while ago a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like they avoided Crocs.
Advertising the brand of a hoodie or a t-shirt was seen somewhat rustic.
But times, they are a-changing.
Sportiness has been a real mega trend in fashion, and that means also old familiar sport fashion brands like Adidas and Nike have risen to the crest of the cool wave.
And like so many times before, the line between funny and trendy is fine: if something is very bumpkinish, it will start to change into ironic and cool.
First came norm core trend, or regular fashion, in which trendsetters surprised by favouring as boring as possible basic clothes as if as a way to separate themselves from the masses.
Now, instead of a basic grey sweatshirts they wear the sweats that were already buried in the bottom of the wardrobe and that have a brand logo in front of them.
The bigger and more traditional the better.
In addition to logos, also for example the recognisable Adidas stripes, jerseys of your favourite team and New York Yankees baseball caps have made a return to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos in underwear peaking from under the edge of jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sport brands also to luxury brands.
For example the chest of Versace's autumn shirts makes the brand of the garment quite obvious.
Would you be prepared to showcase logos in your clothing?
