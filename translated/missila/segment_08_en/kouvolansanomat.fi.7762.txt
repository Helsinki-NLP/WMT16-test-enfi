Boys climbed to a roof, one could not come down, the friends ran off
The rescue department helped the 12-year-old who climbed to the roof and then could not get down off the hook.
The situation arose at Ketotie street in the district of TornionmĂ¤ki around 5.30 PM on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-story wooden house without ladders leading to the roof.
That did not stop the group of boys, who decided to climb to the roof by using the old radio amateur mast beside the house.
Other boys managed to use the route also for descent, but one could not.
The result was that the others ran off and the passers-by called the rescue department to help the last boy from the roof safely to the ground with the help of their extension ladder.
