Asylum seeker registration centre possibly to Tornio
Government-planned asylum seeker registration centre to Northern Finland will most likely be established to Tornio.
The centre is planned to be set up in an empty Tornio yhteislyseo school building in the town centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been searching for a suitable place, in order to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, Helsingin Sanomat reported that the council would have already decided to propose the school building as a space solution for the Ministry.
According to the vice-chair of Tornio town council, Sauli HyĂ¶ppinen (Left) this is not true.
Since the whole council was not present and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to call for a council meeting for next Monday to decide on the matter, he clarified to STT.
There were 36 of the 43 delegates present in the discussion gathering.
The registration centre was opposed by 13 delegates.
Based on this, the decision can be expected to be positive, HyĂ¶ppinen says.
According to the Mayor, Timo Nousiainen, the town received a contact about the matter on Monday, and they were quick to react.
It is estimated that the school building would house 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked that the building could be suitable for this kind of use.
The location is about 200 metres from the border, so it would be functional also in that sense, says Nousiainen.
