One discordant note for â€˜Siun soteâ€™ reform package on healthcare and social welfare
Joensuu city executive board ostensibly agree on provincial â€˜Siun soteâ€™ project, but one discordant note could be heard.
A member of the board, Pentti Keskisalo (Social Democrats, in the picture) mooted to abandon the whole project at a board meeting on Monday, but his motion was dismissed as it was not supported.
The board agreed on a draft decision by mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed in the beginning of October before the meeting of the executive board that will give a final opinion on the project at the same time with all the other municipalities.
