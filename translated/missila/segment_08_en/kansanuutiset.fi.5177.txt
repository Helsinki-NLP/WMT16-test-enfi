Akava President Sture FjĂ¤der hopes that SAK, head by Lauri Lyly, will join in in preparing a proposal as an alternative to cuts.
Antti Palolaâ€™s STTK said earlier on Wednesday that new proposals are being drafted.
We want change security and working time banks.
Akava reported on Wednesday that it has for already a long time been preparing its own proposal to negotiate the countryâ€™s governmentâ€™s aim of five percent competitiveness leap as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been willing to negotiate the whole time, and we have already for a long time been writing an alternative model for the governmentâ€™s proposals.
We are ready to consider conditions of employment as part of the deal.
In return we want change security and working time banks, say the President Sture FjĂ¤der.
FjĂ¤der hopes that also SAK would think on similar terms with Akava, like STTK already did on Wednesday.
Without SAK the package is not strong enough.
Together we will now prepare a model that is acceptable to the government and to employers, says FjĂ¤der.
Akavaâ€™s working committee will meet on Thursday at 15 oâ€™clock to decide on the possible contents of the agreement.
