Here is the favourite object of interior design bloggers
The candleholder designed by architect brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen from 1962 still looks like it was designed today.
The cubical steel frame is like a work of art, and that is what it originally was, too.
The architect brothers are known to polish the candleholder shape for a long time and with mathematical precision.
Initially it was only presented to the gentlemenâ€™s esteemed dinner guests.
Kubus candleholder is made by family business By Lassen, who uphold the design tradition of the famous brothers.
The candleholder is crafted by hand in Holstebro, Denmark, in versions for eight, four and one candles, in ofur different colours.
Kubus is available in black and white, as well as nickel and copper-plated.
The candleholder is current right now and it suits many different homes.
Lately it has been the favourite object of especially interior design bloggers.
