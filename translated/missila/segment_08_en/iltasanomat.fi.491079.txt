Danskeâ€™s KuoppamĂ¤ki: IMF warns against too many cuts
Today the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released its country report for Finland, and it is mainly in line with the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation urged Finland to apply comprehensive structural reforms in order to overcome economic problems.
According to IMF, reducing overtime compensations and paid days off would support Finlandâ€™s competitiveness.
Reforms are needed in the whole agreement system and in unemployment benefits.
According to Danske Bank chief economist, Pasi KuoppamĂ¤ki, there is a consensus on structural reforms, but also some differences.
There are many approving messages for the governmentâ€™s actions in the IMF report, but also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
These include, for example, investments on infrastructure, KuoppamĂ¤ki told to Taloussanomat.
IMF considers that also the growth projects should be executed as quickly as possible, so that they would support weak economic growth.
For this year, IMF forecast for Finland is 0.4 per cent economic growth, which is expected to rise to 0.9 per cent the next year.
In their new economic outlook, Danske expects the growth this year will remain at zero per cent.
IMF is slightly more optimistic about this year.
They might have used recent observations as their basis.
This morning, Statistics Finland said the total production was slightly growing during the summer, says KuoppamĂ¤ki.
It is possible that the so called softer indicators, like for example decreased confidence in industry, have not been paid so much attention to.
The difference is, however, only some decimals of a per cent.
