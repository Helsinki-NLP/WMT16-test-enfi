Austrian police has asked the Central Criminal Police to help in investigating the background of the Finnish-registered refugee truck.
On Sunday, Austrian police halted a truck with 42 refugees in Aisterheim near the German border.
There is no information whether the truck was possible on its way to Finland.
Those aboard the refrigerated truck are all in good condition.
We have exchanged information with Austrian police.
The investigation is conducted and the main responsibility is in Austria, the location where this happened, says chief inspector Tero Haapala from the Central Criminal Police.
Other refugees travelling aboard a truck in Austria had worse luck.
Then all 71 passengers apparently asphyxiated.
According to Yleisradio, who first reported the cooperation with Austrian police, the truck is owned by a Finnish limited company.
The company practices for instance catering and has a person of foreign origin, a man of about 40 years, as its managing director.
