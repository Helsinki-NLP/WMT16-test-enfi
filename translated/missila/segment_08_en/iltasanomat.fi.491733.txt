It is possible to order a wife from a Japanese cafe - she will serve a meal wearing only bikinis and an apron
Theme cafes are a big hit in Japan.
There is already a goat cafe, a rabbit cafe, a vampire cafe, a cuddling cafe - and now, a wife cafe.
The service is a hit for the lonely, in need of company and hungry.
Metro reported on the matter.
The Tokyo cafe Ore no Yome (‘My Wife’) offers a possibility to order a wife or a husband for the evening.
This is a waiter/waitress, who pretends to be the client’s spouse.
You choose the “spouse” from a list beforehand, and they will then cook and serve the meal.
The wife will welcome you wearing only bikinis and a kitchen apron, while the husband will be wearing nothing but tight cycling shorts.
The website offers information on the wife candidates, everything from their height and weight to what kind of a mattress they like to sleep on.
