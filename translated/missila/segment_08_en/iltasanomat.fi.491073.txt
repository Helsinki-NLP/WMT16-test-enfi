A leakage in KittilĂ¤ mine operated by a Canadian-based mining company Agnico Eagle Finland
The gold mineâ€™s treated process water has been leaking from the so called tailing pond to a trench.
According to the company, measures to repair the leak have been taken.
The pond contains neutralised ore-processing sand and treated process water from the flotation process.
Usually the water is either pumped to be used again as a process water or conveyed through an overland flow field to the environment, as specified in the permit.
The leakage was about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was discovered.
According to the company, the leak water quality complies with the current permit conditions.
Other materials did not leak to the environment.
The leak was discovered during an inspection round on Monday morning.
There are no observed structural damages to the dam structures of the pond.
The company says they are working in close co-operation with the officials to follow and repair the situation.
The mine amploys about six hundred regular workers.
