Nintendo recovering from a death, names a new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima worked under Satoru Iwata, passed away in July because of cancer, and now starts in his new job on Wednesday, Nintendo announced on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo from 2002, and he was a popular and charismatic figure in the gaming industry.
Iwata was responsible for example launching the successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were part of the speculation as to possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwataâ€™s steps, estimates Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda to Reuters.
Leading Nintendo strongly to mobile gaming is seen as Kimishimaâ€™s task, but in a way that it does not diminish the livelihood of the traditional game consoles.
