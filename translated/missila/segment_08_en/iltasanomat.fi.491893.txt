Roope Salminen had a change of style to play the role of the least known Apulanta musician in a film
Roope Salminen will play the role of the founding member of Apulanta, Antti Lautala, in the film based on the early years of the band.
Lautala started Apulanta in 1991 together with Toni Wirtanen, but left the band in 1994.
This is quite a challenge to me, since Iâ€™m a rap artist of nearly 26 years, and in the film Iâ€™m a 16-year-old guitarist, laughs Salminen.
I havenâ€™t wanted to meet the real Antti before shooting, since I want to make my own interpretation of him.
Antti is clearly the least known of that group, so I think itâ€™s a good thing Iâ€™m learning his style of playing only from a video.
I donâ€™t want to make an imitation of a person.
The head of Roope Salminen ja Koirat band does not have to play the role starting from a scratch.
According to Salminen, punk mannerisms come naturally to him.
In the punk episode of TĂ¤hdet, tĂ¤hdet show many people surely had a foretaste, and the same applies if you have ever come to our gigs.
Our gigs have never been conventional, but we always have a full speed on.
The main actors for the film Teit meistĂ¤ kauniin, directed by Apulanta bassist of 1993-2004 Tuukka Temonen, were announced today.
Young actors that are still somewhat unknown to the public play the roles of the familiar core group of the band.
Teppo Manner will be drummer Sipe Santapukki, Tatu Sinisalo is singer Toni Wirtanen, and Iiro Panula is bassist Tuukka Temonen.
Roope Salminen hinted about his future job already yesterday evening, when he on Snapchat mysteriously stated he is preparing for the most important day of his career.
Already yesterday Roope posted an image of his new look for the film to Instagram.
Earlier seen sporting a moustache and a soul patch, now Roope has smoothly shaven cheeks and he has dyed his brown hair black.
