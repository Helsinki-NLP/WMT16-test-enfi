Nina Mikkonen is selling Timo T.A.â€™s studio online - see the pictures from the equipment
The equipment used in TV and radio productions of the pioneer in the field of media, Timo T.A. Mikkonen, who lost his ability to work because of seizures, is now on sale.
Mikkonen's partner Nina Mikkonen is selling the equipment, once cutting-edge among the professionals of the field, at Huuto.net.
Online magazine Iltamakasiini was the first to tell about the online ad.
Today most of the equipment has fell behind with the technoloical development.
Nobody in the world of digital media films television programmes on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still trustful that there will be interested buyers.
Obviously the equipment is not up-to-date like that, but these will also be needed as long as there exists such material from the old generation that has to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of hobbyists - collectors and those building their own studio, said Nina Mikkonen to IS.
The reason for sale is that Mikkonens tryi to move out from their current home in MyrskylĂ¤.
There is no way we can take all these things with us.
Little by little I have started doing an inventory to see, what things we are going to give up.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen
We do not use these TV and radio devices ourselves anymore.
After the cerebral infarctions earlier it is clear that this man with a long career will not return to working life anymore.
Nina Mikkonen notes that they are only selling things and equipment now.
Timo T.A. Mikkonenâ€™s actual life's work was archived already in the summer in the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives picked up boxes full of films and other material from MyrskylĂ¤.
