Pallosalama striking Vermo is hard to control
Perttu Pohjola managed to coach Apilan Pallosalama into a fierce condition in the midsummer.
It trotted only first and second places, until it collapsed in the end of July in Tampere harness race.
Since the stallion was completely exhausted, the trainer thought there is something wrong with it and reserved a vet appointment for his charge.
The explanation for exhaustion was found after a viewing.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest possible, but required two courses of medication before it was conquered.
Since Apilan Pallosalama had to be restricted to light exercise, Pohjola says he is positively surprised about the horseâ€™s last run.
In Turku it trotted a record time and was second after the Finlandâ€™s best, mare Taruntuuli.
Apilan Pallosalama was quite energetic after the break, since it could have been trained normally only for some weeks.
Taking all of this into consideration, it is understandable that there was a drop towards the end, says Pohjola.
The trainer supposes that a proper competition did the stallion good.
The shape of the horse progressed surely, and hopefully it also balanced.
Apilan Pallosalama is a so called humorous horse.
When it hasnâ€™t felt up to it, it mightâ€™ve stopped trying even without sickness.
Instead on a good day the stallion has had such a lightning spurt that the competitors have been amazed.
The competitors are not a match in short distance speed to Pallosalama, who can run almost in a thoroughbred kind of way.
Pohjola hopes for a slipstream run at Vermo.
But it is a whole different thing how Apilan Pallosalama feels about that.
It can be pretty tricky during the start, and might for example sneak under the boom of the start car or something like that.
I hope the stallion would be more calm than in Turku.
When Apilan Pallosalama is in condition, it can also come from the front and we will race to win, promises the trainer.
