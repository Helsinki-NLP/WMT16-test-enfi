Reducing trains cut the vitality of the region
The train cuts strike straight to the vitality of the region.
The train connections have a direct effect on the industrial life and competitiveness of the region.
And this again has an effect on whether it is even possible to live and work here, wonders the mayor of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen.
He also highlights the air travel, the continuation of which has several times been at issue.
It is vital for the whole region that our chances to survive are not diminished by the actions of the authorities, as it is now happening.
The effect of reducing these connections on for example the employment situation should be discussed, emphasises Karjalainen.
The deterioration of connections causes extra challenges to the University of Eastern Finland as to its attractiveness.
Naturally, the better the services like traffic connections and access to housing, the easier it is to find students and staff, states the rector of the University of Eastern Finland, Jukka MĂ¶nkkĂ¶nen.
He notes that the poor accessibility also has an impact to the researchers, who have a high mobility and travel a lot because of their research.
The head of student recruitment, Marko Junkkarinen, says that already now it is difficult to market the university in the Western Finland, since the transverse connections are poor.
About half of the students in the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
From these students, about 10-20 per cent come from Uusimaa, whichc is partly explained with the direct train connection.
