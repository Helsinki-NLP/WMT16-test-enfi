Psychologist advises: This is how to tell children about refugees
Many parent has had to wonder about how to tell a child about the situation of the refugees coming to Europe.
Or should they tell anything about it?
You do not have to force the discussion, advises member of the Finnish Red Cross crisis group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff.
You should protect smaller children and not let them for example watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and that can remain whirling in their minds, causing anxiety, he says.
If a child has seen an image of refugees in the television or heard about it elsewhere, you should discuss the matter.
You should start the discussion from the child’s point of view and listen closely what she or he asks.
Fears of a child can be surprising.
They are necessary not the same a parent thinks the child is fearing.
You should not scare the child for no reason, even though you yourself are anxious or even scared.
A smaller child closely follows parents’ behaviour.
If parents stay calm during the discussion, also the child feels safe.
Bigger children most likely hear discussion about refugees in school, with friends or online.
If the child is thinking about the matter, the parents should discuss it with the child.
The fact is that not all the people in the world are well-off.
The parents can, together with the children, think how our family feels about this.
Do we think the world is eventually a safe or an unsafe place.
The parents may also have different parenting views - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as well as they can.
On the other hand: If the family discusses also the difficult issues, the child is given a model about how to deal with difficulties in life.
This can come in handy later.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: “Teach your child to help the weaker ones”
No more strength left?
You can still be a good parent for your child.
