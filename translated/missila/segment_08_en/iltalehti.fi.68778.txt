SAK sits on its view about the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK President Lauri Lyly told on Twitter that the labour organisation will consider its opinion about STTK’s alternative savings list on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK proposal on Twitter.
The Finnish Confederation of Professionals STTK said earlier on Wednesday they are going to present the Government their own proposal, which would able to reach the five per cent productivity leap required by the Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).
Akava President Sture Fjäder believes that the Government will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava all stand behind it.
That would require though that the biggest labour organisation SAK softens its earlier opinion.
As for SAK President Lauri Lyly, he commented the matter briefly on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK work committee will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to “open the labour market lock”, and that instead of mandatory laws, what is needed are agreements between active parties.
Lyly reminds people that SAK did not accept Prime Minister Sipilä’s Government’s proposal for social contract.
Earlier Sipilä ended the discussions about social contract after SAK did not agree to commit itself to the goal of five per cent productivity leap.
