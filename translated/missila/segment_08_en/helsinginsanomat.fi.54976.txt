UN demands war criminals in Sri Lanka to be judged
UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate the war crimes committed in Sri Lankaâ€™s civil war, reports press office AFP.
The UN report on the civil war of 1983-2009 was unveiled on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report accuses both the security forces of Sri Lanka and the rebels, known as Tamil Tigers, of war crimes.
It is estimated that at least 100,000 people died in the civil war.
There is no accurate information on the number of the victims.
The UN report calls for proper investigation of especially the armed forcesâ€™ great assault during the last months of the long war in 2009.
The report accuses the Sri Lankan security forces of torture, kidnappings and systematic sexual abuse targeted men as likely as women.
According to the report, the rebels are guilty of forcing outsiders and children to fight.
Both sides have committed murders, states the report.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it is going to organise an investigation, but not going to allow UN to establish a special court, because of the foreign judges.
