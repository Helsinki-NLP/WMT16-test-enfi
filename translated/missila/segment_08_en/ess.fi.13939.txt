Yle: Onnibus wants a share in Finnish railways
The owner of the low-fare bus service operator Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter said to Yle that the company has also set their sights on Finnish railway traffic.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish railway traffic.
My company Stagecoach is one of the largest railway traffic companies in Britain, said Souter.
The competition in the railway traffic is to be opened gradually.
First part to open is metropolitan area commuter rail in 2017-2018.
After commuter rail, intercity service will open up.
Souter says he has already contacted Ministry of Transport and Communications.
According to Yle, the ministry considers Onnibus plans welcome.
As to other international companies, at least Transdev (previously Veolia) has announced that they are interested in the railway traffic. The company also has bus services in Finland and railway traffic elsewhere in Europe.
