Chisuâ€™s return to stage in a striking jumpsuit
Singer Chisu takes part in ElĂ¤mĂ¤ Lapselle (Life for Children) concert together with other Finnish stars.
Her electric blue jumpsuit has a flamboyant, low-cut neckline.
The outfit prettily highlights the star singerâ€™s petite waist.
The ensemble is topped off with a golden metallic belt and red lipstick.
During her three-year break, the singer had a child and then managed to shed the pregnancy weight with light exercise and yoga.
Chisuâ€™s daughter is soon one year old.
The singer released the first single from her upcoming record in August.
Returning to stage and in front of the public after a long break doesnâ€™t really make me nervous.
I have missed all the things related to music, the singer says.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu releases her new, fourth album called Polaris.
A new situation in life has inspired me to write new songs.
At this stage I wonder, whether people will discover my new album, Chisu tells.
