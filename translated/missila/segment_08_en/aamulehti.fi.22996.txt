Zimbabweâ€™s President Robert Mugabe has read out the same speech he already gave a month ago.
Zimbabweâ€™s President Robert Mugabe has read out the same speech in the parliament he already gave in the end of the last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realise that the speech was same than before.
The speech raised doubts about whether 91-year-old Mugabe is of a sound mind.
The main opposition party MDC calls for Mugabeâ€™s resignation, as he is too old to lead.
Mugabeâ€™s spokesmen rushed to state that the mix-up happened only in Mugabeâ€™s secretarial office, and that the President has done nothing wrong.
Mugabeâ€™s speech then and now discussed China's effect on the countryâ€™s economy.
