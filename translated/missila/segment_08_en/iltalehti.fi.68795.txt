Russia said Finland was a bad host: “This cannot happen again”
The Russian speaker of the lower house of parliament, Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
According to Russian speaker of the lower house of the parliament, Sergei Naryshkin, said Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The Autumn Meeting of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has began in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, where Naryshkin thoroughly commented on the Helsinki anniversary meeting in July.
Finland did not allow the Russian politicians, like Naryshkin, who had ended on the European Union blacklist to take part in the meeting - a matter the speaker continued to remind the reporters about.
According to our estimation, this was against the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This cannot happen again, emphasised Naryshkin according to news agency Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin also criticised the United States, who also banned him from entering the country.
The sanctions are a political suicide for EU, declared Naryshkin.
The Russian delegation had no problems entering Mongolia, so Naryshkin continued to snipe at Finland by complimenting and acknowledging Mongolia for its “excellent organising”.
I am sure that the parliamentary assembly will be constructive and have positive results, unlike the July summit in Helsinki.
Mongolian leadership understand that there are supposed to be no obstacles for parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanerva (Coalition), who conducts the meeting in Ulaanbaatar and, accordin to Russian media, has already had discussions with the Russian delegation.
