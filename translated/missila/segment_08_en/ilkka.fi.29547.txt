Kauhajoki newspaper: A complaint to Chancellor of Justice has been filed about establishing a reception centre to Kauhava
The Finnish Immigration Service and Finnish Red Cross work in cooperation to establish a refugee reception centre to Kauhava garrisonâ€™s ex-facilities, now owned by LSK Business Park.
The complaint states that there is still permanent infrastructure for time of crisis, and it is still in use by the National Defence Forces and its cooperation partner, State Security Networks Ltd.
Kauhajoki newspaper says that according to a private individual, locating the reception centre in the same building complex would pose a significant security risk, which has not been taken into consideration in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complaintive, the National Defence Force may have interests related to the previous area of Training Air Wing and the airfield, the effect of which has similarly not been considered while preparing the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The story states that as far as Kauhava airfield is concerned, during the last two years there have been discussions on organising flight education and on possible arrival of a foreign operator on the airfield.
The matter has also been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi NiinistĂ¤ (True Finns) and Permanent Secretary from Ministry of Defence Arto RĂ¤ty.
The private individual states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not about opposing reception centres in principle, but about the location in the previous garrison area being wrong.
Kauhava town board discussed the reception centre matter on last Monday.
