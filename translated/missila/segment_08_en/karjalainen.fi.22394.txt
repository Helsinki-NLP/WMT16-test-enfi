A place also for Karelian language in Joensuu
The city board toned down its previous intransigent position on bringing street name signs in Karelian language to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right, when considering continuing the Karelian tradition in the whole region.
Joensuu is not proclaiming itself to be the capital of Karelian language, since the claim does not have historical grounds, and Karelian language is not a natural part of the areaâ€™s identity.
The language spoken in the Joensuu area is more part of the eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after the new decision there will be no street signs in Karelian language to be found from the city centre.
The city of Joensuu is, however, on a case-by-case basis and with careful though also ready to use Karelian language in for instance information boards and tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same attitude for all the other operators, as well.
Even though officially Joensuu is a monolingual town, we should be open in our approach also to Karelian language users now that multiculturalism is alive and strongly transforming also in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still one of the characteristics of the region, as is the idea of Joensuu being the forest capital of whole Finland.
These both can well be utilised in various marketing in the region.
