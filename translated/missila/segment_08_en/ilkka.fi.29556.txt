NiinistĂ¶: The situation in Syria reflects to Ukraine and to Baltic Sea region
The control means that the immigrants and those already here have the necessary conditions, NiinistĂ¶ commented to the reporters in the evening after meeting with all the leaders of the parliamentary parties at his residence in MĂ¤ntyniemi.
According to the President, concern over refugee situation control connected all the participants.
He considers it valuable that in Finland both the ruling and the opposition parties can have a confidential discussion about fundamental questions.
Especially during these times we have great challenges in front of us
According to NiinistĂ¶, the situation in Syria as well as the Russian and American actions in the region can have an effect also on the situation in Ukraine, and ultimately in the Baltic Sea region.
NiinistĂ¶ is optimistic about the dialogue developing.
If the situation can progress positively, i.e. if the United States and Russia can, it will have an effect to the situation in Ukraine and further to the tense situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to NiinistĂ¶, Nato question was also touched upon in the discussions.
The president did not take a stand on the labour market situation.
