Muslim boy arrested in Texas school - teacher thought a self-made clock a bomb
A 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was arrested in Texas, United States, after a teacher thought the self-made clock he brought to school was a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News he only wanted to demonstrate a result of his electronics hobby.
One of the teachers, however, thought the clock looked exactly like a bomb.
The police were called in and the situation finally ended in the boy being taken in handcuffs to juvenile detention.
At no stage has Muhamed claimed anything else besides that he made a clock.
It is still possible that the boy is charged with making a hoax bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police stated the clock looked like a “movie bomb”.
The police has the clock, but as far as is known, it contained a circuit board and a digital display with wires in between.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohamed was punished with a three-day suspension from school.
His father is furious about the incident, and the country’s Council of American-Islamic Relations is wondering, whether the case is yet another display of islamophobia in the United States.
